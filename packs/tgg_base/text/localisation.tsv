A workshop is a vital resource for the community, whatever it produces. These small-scale industries have a large role to play in the tribe’s prosperity and survival.

Beads, for example, were an important craft product in Native American society. They were used in ceremonial jewellery and clothing and as a form of currency where barter was not used. Despite the large number of people involved in craftwork, the tribes never used anything more powerful than human muscle in their industries."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_craft_workshops_european	"

Craft workshops are the basis of a thriving economy. Each craftsman and his family work from dawn to dusk to produce a bale of cloth, a carpet, cutlery, swords, guns – anything, in fact, that needs to be made. The system has hardly changed in centuries.

Craftsmen are paid piecework rates, making it in their interests to have the whole family labouring away. Each workshop produces a complete item from start to finish of the manufacturing process, and there is little organisation involved in producing the finished goods. This small-scale approach does impose limits on overall production.

Historically, it was possible for craft-based techniques to produce large quantities of goods, but only by having entire communities working in the same craft. The steel town of Sheffield, England, became a centre of cutlery making (and later steel production) on the strength of its craft-based workshops. The coming of mills would sweep away generations of expertise, as jobs were de-skilled and mechanised."	false

Since Venus is the larger of the two bodies (and thus obscured Mercury), the event is known as an occultation as opposed to a transit. For this event to occur it is necessary for an alignment of three planets: the two planets being viewed, and the planet from which the observation is made.

Though such planetary alignments have occurred five times in the last four decades, ordinarily they are incredibly rare. Bevis is therefore the only man known to have directly witnessed the even rarer phenomenon of planetary occultation!"	false

Fast moving and highly skilled, these men are truly skilled horsemen. They do not fire their carbines whilst mounted, however, preferring to ride men down and dispatch them with cold steel.

However, should they find themselves facing well-disciplined line infantry, formed in square, their weaknesses would swiftly become evident.

Lee’s Legion was commanded by Henry ‘Light horse’ Lee, the father of famed Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Henry Lee’s first commission was as Captain of the Virginia Light Dragoons. During his time as a captain he caught the eye of Washington while leading a series of successful raids on enemy supply trains. At Paulus Hook, New Jersey, he increased his renown by taking 400 British soldiers prisoner with the loss of only one of his cavalrymen. This action earned him a gold medal, an honour usually reserved for only men of general’s rank."	false

Cannons are a most destructive force indeed, but not a brave or noble way of fighting! But, as enemies have cannons, only a foolish tribe would not seek to protect their land and people. The strength of the tribes may be in stealth and surprise, but a new weapon of such power demands new ways.

Historically, the use of cannon by Native Americans was rare, as the European settlers carefully controlled their artillery pieces. They were given away rarely, for a tribe with heavy guns would be a threat indeed. In 1661, the Maryland colonists, supplied their allies, the Susquehannocks, with men, ammunition and a cannon with which to defend their village against Iroquois attack."	false

A shadowy band of ""magnetic spies"" - the ""Air Loom Gang"" - are said to have perfected the ""Air Loom"": a diabolical mesmerism machine able to influence and persecute individuals from a distance through the medium of animal magnetism.

The malign effects of the Air Loom, what Tilly refers to as ""torture-at-a-distance"", are evidenced by ""foot-curving, lethargy-making, spark-exploding, knee-nailing, burning out, eye-screwing"". The unfortunate Matthews now proclaims himself a victim of these symptoms, doubtless as a result of attempts by the pitiless gang to silence his momentous revelations.

Undeterred, the gallant Mr Matthews recently took the matter to the House of Commons, crying ""Treason!"" at the Home Office minister, whom he felt to be implicated in the plot. Shortly afterwards he was removed from the House, and is currently residing in the nearby Bethlem Hospital for those not entirely connected to the real world."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_sikh_musketeers	"

Sikhs are a distinctive community from northern India; they are easily recognised by their turbans, beards and uncut hair. They also carry swords as one of the marks of their faith, and sometimes for less ceremonial purposes. In addition to being a devout people, Sikhs have a proud martial tradition, like many in the Punjab. As fighters, they are fierce foes, and rightly feared by their neighbours and enemies.

Historically, Sikhism is the youngest of the world’s major religions. The word “sikh” can be translated as disciple or pupil. Arising in 15th Century Mughal India, the leaders of the new faith were often persecuted by the Mughals, although sometimes for political rather than religious reasons. With the decline in Mughal power, the Sikhs managed to carve out a kingdom of their own, and gave the advancing British several nasty shocks. It is noticeable that the British Raj later made very extensive use of Sikh troops. Even today, when Sikhs are only a tiny percentage of India’s population, they represent a substantial part of the Indian Army’s officer corps."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_12_lber_howitzer	"

Howitzers fall somewhere between guns and mortars, the other main artillery types. They have a limited mobility, like guns. Like mortars, they do not fire straight at the target, but send shots high into the air to plunge down on a target (and over anything in the way). By angling the barrel and changing the propellant charge used, howitzers have an impressive flexibility in shell trajectories. Experienced crews can lob explosive shells and incendiary rounds with great accuracy into a “beaten zone”, making life utterly miserable and very short for anyone within it. In close action, they can fire canister rounds directly into enemy formations, like giant sawn-off shotguns.

The term foot artillery applies because the gunners walk into battle alongside the draft animals. Like all artillery, the rating of these howitzers refers to the nominal weight of shot fired; loading the heavier pieces made for strong gunners!

Historically, howitzers – like many other artillery pieces – were far from standardised weapons in the 18th Century. Shells and spare parts made in one foundry did not always fit another foundry’s pieces, even if the calibre was nominally identical and the two guns were part of the same battery in the field. It took a good deal of effort and argument to get foundries to standardise barrels and ancillary equipment, even in a single country."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_spinning_frame	"

Raw cotton or wool must be spun into thread before it can be used in weaving. This was traditionally “woman’s work” when weaving was a cottage-based craft. Powered and larger looms demanded more thread than manual labour could supply, hence the need for a machine that could spin yarn. The spinning frame also needs few skilled workers, just quick operators who can keep the spindles turning and their fingers out of the whirling mechanism.

English mill owner and entrepreneur (1733-1792) is credited with the patent on the spinning frame, although there is a good chance he was not the inventor. The machine was so large it virtually demanded a special mill be constructed, and weaving left its cottage roots behind as Arkwright’s business expanded. His mill in Cromford, Derbyshire, established the shift system and what looks to modern eyes like a form of industrial slavery for the workforce. Workers were locked out if late, docked wages for all manner of infractions, and not allowed to leave the village during their annual holiday week!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_governors_mansion_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	"

Absolute monarchy is an effective and sometimes brutal form of government. The monarch’s powers are not limited in any way. What the monarch decrees simply happens. If it does not, heads roll, often literally! 

The machinery of provincial government receives the same authority from the Crown. A governor, thalur or bey (depending on the nation in question) has the power to do almost anything to his subjects, providing he delivers what his monarch requires – and this is usually tax income and soldiers. Any other considerations can be put to one side; it is the duty of subjects to obey in an absolute state, and those who dare to argue back are quite rightly treated as faithless rebels. 

Historically, absolutism was the main form of government in many 18th Century states. Louis XIV of France was speaking the truth when he reputedly claimed “L’État, c’est moi!” Like other absolutists and their apologists, he sincerely believed that he was responsible for his actions only to God."	false

The profits, however, can be substantial, and this wealth is often reinvested in recreating an upper-crust lifestyle for the plantation’s owning family. This is true even in republics: egalitarianism only extends so far, and rarely includes the field hands doing the back-breaking labour! Owners behave with staggering levels of brutality towards their workers, regardless of whether or not they are formally slaves. Partly, of course, it is fear that leads them to behave this way: the workers outnumber the overseers many times over. 

A large plantation is also an island of home luxuries in an alien land. Owners have money to import anything and everything from home, and some take the opportunity to behave like kings in their own tiny empires. They are the propertied classes, the ones with influence, and few people at home really care about their methods."	false

Although sharpshooting involves bullets rather than arrows, the idea is the same: pick your target, aim carefully, and let fly. When outmatched, any tactical advantage that can be gained through the use of carefully positioned marksmen is welcome. A tribe that can pass skills from warrior to warrior makes the best use of its people too.

Early firearms used by the Native Americans were single-shot, muzzle-loading flintlock pistols. These guns inspired awe and fear, but were, in fact, primitive, inaccurate and unwieldy.  It was only after the arrival of repeating breech-loaders that the bow became largely obsolete, and by then the natives had become masters of firearms in both hunting and warfare."	false

Small arms may turn a rabble into a rebellion, but cannons create an army. Governments rightly want a monopoly on the ownership of heavy guns, and rightly see them as a measure of national power. A lack of guns severely hampers any military force, limiting it to little more than skirmish actions.

Once cast, artillery barrels could spend decades in storage. Providing that they were dry, there was little chance that they would come to much harm. When needed, a barrel was fitted to a gun carriage, ammunition and a limber found, and a piece was ready. Cannons could also be remade by fitting the barrel to a different carriage: a cannon for fortress use was mounted differently to a field gun.

Fire in an artillery park was a constant risk, bringing the danger of explosions, but damp conditions would ruin powder stocks just as surely. Water turned powder in a porridge, which then had to be dried very carefully and “corned” – turned into smooth grains of the right size – once again. Drying and crushing spoiled gunpowder was a ticklish task!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_ottomans_naval_engineering_school	"

The Naval Engineers’ School began as a training school at the Golden Horn shipyards, and was put on a formal footing by Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha (1713-90), the Grand Vizier of Sultan Mustafa III, and a Franco-Hungarian military adviser, François Baron de Tott. It was a part of Mustafa’s efforts to modernise the Turkish military and naval system in the face of considerable resistance from the janissaries and their leadership. The teaching given was extremely good, and produced fine officers.

Hasan Pasha is actually almost more interesting than the school, as he started life as a slave in eastern Turkey and rose through the ranks of the military. He even spent time with the Barbary Pirates of Algiers and, while there, domesticated a lion as a pet! Despite being on the losing side at Battle of Chesma in 1770 his ship, the 84-gun Real Mustafa, was one of the few on the Turkish side to emerge with any credit. His record certainly helped when it came to driving through the (limited) reforms that Mustafa managed to achieve. Baron de Tott’s other achievement was the establishment of a new cannon foundry."	false

For the first time together in a single volume, the list contains the names, physical descriptions and sexual predilections and ""specialities"" of each lady, along with their cost. The list itself sells at a steal for two shillings and sixpence. Harris’ list has in fact been written by struggling Irish poet Samuel Derrick, in order to extricate himself from debtor’s prison.

Although Harris has given his name and official seal to the project, this is probably only for reasons of personal vanity - as the publication of a list allowing potential customers direct access to ladies may actually prevent him from plying his unpleasant trade so easily in future!"	false

Living in a desert makes a man tough and ruthless, or dead. The weak do not survive, and this fierce cull produces proud and dangerous warriors. Their battle skills have been honed by years of raiding and goat thievery, or against the more settled people of oasis villages. Defeat is unthinkable, because defeat is death.

Traditionally, the Bedouin were among the most dangerous of desert tribes, fighting among themselves when outsiders weren’t available. Constantly on the move to find new pastures for their livestock, they learned to live with the minimum of possessions and little external support in the harshest of lands. Loyalty to tribe and family was all that helped a man survive."	false

Historically, Wahunsonacock was also known as Chief Powhatan. The English settlers took this name from the village in which his tribe lived. The word ‘powhatan’ means ‘at the waterfalls’, as the Powhatan village was built by the falls of the James River. Perhaps his most infamous deed was the attempted murder of Captain John Smith.

Spirits are in everything: they affect the lives of men for both good and evil. A warrior needs constant protection from the ill will of evil spirits and enemies. This is provided by a shaman who communes with the spirits. The efforts of a shaman can increase individual unit morale by helping them discover their spirit medicine.

Each native tribe had its own system of beliefs, the common theme being a belief in the spirits of the earth. Many tribes sought knowledge and power by embarking on vision quests, presided over by shamans. They sought spirit medicine, and this usually took the form of birds and animals that presented themselves in times of need."	false

The British had both ports blockaded, and the French had to wait for one of the blockading fleets to withdraw for re-supply before attempting any rendezvous.

The opportunity came when the British fleet under Admiral Boscawen at Toulon withdrew to Gibraltar. The French under Jean-François de la Clue-Sabran left Toulon, and began to make their way towards Brest. Passing the Straits of Gibraltar, the French were spotted by Boscawen’s lookout ships.

Giving chase, Boscawen’s fleet was only slightly larger than the French force, and caught up with them off the coast of Portugal where battle was joined.

Take control of the British and defeat the French to end the invasion threat to Britain.

Historically, the French fleet separated and Boscawen’s fourteen ships defeated seven French ships."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_armoury_european	"

A central depot for arms, gunpowder, ammunition and supporting equipment allows a nation to standardise the weapons used by its armies and bring some order and economy to the procurement process. Small arms and cannons made to a standard pattern simplify training and allow field repairs, as parts cannibalised from one weapon will fit another.

Gunpowder supplies alone were a nightmare to keep organised and safe. During manufacture, powder was “corned” into grains of different sizes for different weapons. The larger the grains, the slower the powder burned, producing (lower) pressure in a barrel for a longer time. Powder for a cannon used large grains to give a steady push to a shot down the barrel, while musket powder burned at a higher rate producing greater pressure over a short time. Different grained powders were not interchangeable and could be lethal if used wrongly: small arms powder would split a cannon barrel and kill the crew! Gunpowder dust was even more dangerous, and someone carelessly walking through an armoury could cause an explosion by treading on it!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_platoon_firing	"

Nearly all line infantry carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets. These take considerable time to reload after firing: anything up to a minute for poorly trained or nervous troops. During that time, the enemy can close or return fire unmolested. In the time it takes to reload, a unit can be cut down, its half-loaded weapons useless in the face of an aggressive foe. It is sensible to make sure that not everyone in an infantry unit is reloading at the same moment; this, in turn, means that not everyone should be firing at the same time.

Platoon fire is a way of dividing a unit into smaller groups that each fire, reload and fire again in turn. The result is a “rippling fire” down a line formation and, as the last platoon fires its muskets, the first is ready to fire again. A unit can always give some fire to the enemy at all times, even if this is less than a complete volley. When more than one unit is involved all the troops in every first platoon fire, followed by all the second platoons, and so on, creating several rippling barrages down the battle line.

The word “platoon” in this context does not have the modern meaning of being a sub-unit of a military company. Platoon assignment to what was a “fire group” was made on an ad hoc or informal basis, and could mean a whole regiment being assigned to a “platoon”."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_copper_bottoms	"

Wooden ships are a rich feast for many marine animals, and a home for all manner of weeds and barnacles. Over time, any hull becomes fouled with weeds and encrustations to the point that the ship’s speed is compromised. Worse still, given time, worms will eat the planks of a ship to the point where its bottom literally falls out! Other than scraping a beached hull clean, there is no cure; worm eaten timbers have to be chopped out and replaced.

Coppering involves nailing or bolting thin sheets of metal over the whole of a ship’s underside. The copper is toxic to worms and weeds, and greatly extends the working life of a ship, and improves its sea keeping qualities.

Historically, coppering was only a partial solution to the problem of fouling. It worked well in keeping the hull clean but, thanks to an electrolytic reaction with iron bolts used to hold a ship together, the bolts rotted away! The iron, copper and seawater had created a battery, and the (unintentional) iron cathodes were damaged by the reaction."	false

events_event_text_smarty_pants_cheats_electric_death	"Due to the lengthy delay in constructing the Philadelphia church upon he wished to test his ""lightning rod"" - in order to channel lightning strikes to the ground without damage to people or buildings - American Philosophical Society founder Benjamin Franklin proposed an experiment in order to prove that lightning is indeed composed of electricity.

The theory states that electricity should be able to pass from the cloud to the ground via the wet string of a kite, with a key attached to attract the current. Following much speculation on the matter, Frenchman Thomas-Francois Dalibard has proved Franklin's theory by using a forty foot iron rod instead of a kite, observed electrical sparking from the cloud and survived.

Other scientists have not been so lucky - Georg Wilhelm Richmann of St Petersburg was killed in the process due to insufficient insulation, leaving little behind but a smouldering pair of shoes. Upon completion of the church, Franklin fitted his sharpened lightning rod to its spire, stating ""The electrical fire would, I think, be drawn out of a cloud silently, before it could come near enough to strike"".

Although he has been proved correct, the Catholic Church in Europe have banned lightning rods as man-made objects designed to work against the will of God."	false

events_event_text_witchcraft_britain	"The superstition, cruelty, and naked avarice associated with the persecution of so-called witches has been forever consigned to a bygone age, following the passing of a new British Witchcraft Act.

Previous acts removed the crime of witchcraft from the ecclesiastical courts, and saw it tried under common law instead. If the intention was to make the process fairer it was a total failure, as the property of those convicted of witchcraft went to the Crown, so local officials therefore had a stake in seeing a successful conviction. Due to this there was a significant rise in the number of hangings for witchcraft during the seventeenth century.

The new act views those who claim to have mystical powers merely as charlatans, punishing them with fines or imprisonment."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_utilitarianism	"

The many building blocks of society fit together in complex patterns. Understanding this puzzle makes a man wise indeed. Theorists are now using utilitarianism, in an attempt to understand these complexities. This school of thought holds that human will, by its very nature, seeks to serve its own interests. Utilitarianism proposes that in order for a society to function successfully people must begin to consider the utility of their actions and how they affect society as a whole.

Historically, utilitarianism concentrated on the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few. The leading mind in this field was Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), who maintained that nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. He believed that these two factors made mankind infinitely governable, as long as leaders exploited these weaknesses without exploiting those they govern"	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_carbines	"

An infantry musket fires a ball about the width of a man’s thumb: a pound of lead is melted down to make about 10 or 12 rounds. A carbine fires a smaller ball: some 15-17 rounds from the same amount of lead. This smaller bullet does slightly reduce its killing potential, but the reduction in recoil when fired from horseback is welcome. A carbine is, however, just as long as a regular infantry musket, something that makes it awkward to reload while mounted. A carbine is often fitted with a sling-and-swivel to attach it to a cavalryman’s shoulder belt, so that it cannot be lost while riding at speed.

Historically, there was some debate over whether or not regiments of horse should be equipped with firearms at all. John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough, favoured cavalry using cold steel against the enemy. He felt that the morale impact of a cavalry charge was more important than any marginal increase in firepower. As a result, his cavalrymen received a tiny allocation of three rounds apiece – for the whole of a campaign season, not each battle!"	false

Beyond that, it is important to keep an eye on the suspicious Cherokee, who may look north in order to bolster their position against the Spanish aggressors.

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_indian	"

With thick, high walls, impressive towers and many gun positions, the impression created by a fort for any attacker is of overwhelming strength. It will take time and effort to invest such a fort, break its walls with cannon fire and then organise an attack. All the while, the attackers will be prey to disease, starvation and the climate! The defenders may only have to wait for the attackers’ will to fail.

Beyond Europe, the fortification ideas of Vauban and others did not really take root until the arrival of European powers and armies. Traditional fort designs continued in use because they were good enough for their purpose: they intimidated local rebels, and were difficult for them to assault because, as noted, they were unlikely to have substantial artillery siege trains. The “old fashioned” designs were therefore good enough when it took a courageous commander, or a lucky one, to mount a successful attack. There are, however, accounts of an Able Seaman Strahan single-handedly (!) capturing the “fort” (the size is not specified) at Baj-Baj on the Hooghly River in Bengal during Robert Clive’s 1756 campaign."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_cadenced_marching	"

Originally drums were not carried onto the battlefield to provide musical accompaniment to the business of killing. They were there as a “repeater” system for the shouted orders, as it was obvious that a single voice would be lost in the murderous hubbub of battle. However, it was soon realised that a regular beat was useful in teaching men how to load, present and fire their muskets. From that idea it is a short step to making sure that soldiers are trained to do everything to a regular beat, including marching. Drummers, originally intended only to beat a coded tattoo for particular orders, can also keep time for a whole regiment. With cadenced marching, a unit no longer ambles to its destination, it steps out with determination! A cunning colonel can even up the pace and have his men cover more ground by having the drummers beat a little faster!

Historically, many colonels of infantry regiments did pay for bands out of their own pockets, knowing that music could lift the spirits of “the lads” as surely as a bottle of gin."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_spinning_jenny	"

Manual spinning is a slow, tedious business, and one that cannot be speeded up, only given to more hands to do. The spinning jenny mechanises the process, by turning the spindle on its side and having it roll to and fro as the thread is spun. A single worker can, using the jenny, produce eight threads at a time, rather than just one. Quality may suffer, but this is a secondary consideration, as is the well-being of the workers. They are often children, who have hands small enough to reach into the machinery while it is running and would otherwise be idle and undoubtedly given to all manner of mischief.

The device is usually credited to James Hargreaves (1720-1778), a weaver and carpenter from Lancashire in England. While his invention was clever, he was not a businessman or lawyer, and he suffered much lost income as a result of not using patent law properly."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_naval_shore_facilities	"

Ships at sea require regular repairs, even if they are not fighting, as wind and wave will take a toll of even the strongest vessel. Even ships that are not active require some maintenance support, as barnacles and weeds must be removed if sailing performance is not be to compromised. A warship requires a prodigious quantity of stores, food, water and ammunition too: all of these must be collected, properly preserved and then loaded quickly and efficiently. 

All of these tasks mean that navies must have their own dockyards, repair shops and warehouses available at all times. It is not enough to rely on civilian capacity. 

Historically, the Royal Navy was the largest single industrial “business” in the 18th Century world. A huge fleet demanded shore facilities such as dockyards on an equally vast scale, and in every part of the world. Just supplying the fleet with food, drink and spare parts required tremendous purchasing organisation, but the Navy was also capable of building and repairing vessels. Even British foreign policy in places like the Baltic was dominated by the need to keep the navy supplied (with mast timbers and tar, in the case of the Baltic)."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_drydock_european	"

Within the dry dock, the ship is supported on blocks, and extra timbers are used to wedge firmly upright as the water is removed. By carefully timing the movement of a ship to take advantage of high and low tides, the amount of pumping (by hand) is minimised. Movements into and out of the dock are tidal, and work must be finished by the next high tide. 

The advantages of being able to work on a warship and then float it away are considerable. Dry docks are equally useful for construction and repair, and are often at the centre of a large complex of workshops specialising in every aspect of shipbuilding.

The organisation required for all this activity means that the craft-based skills of the master shipwright are still valuable, but naval architects producing plans, drawings and schedules are now a vital part of the process. Naturally, the master of the docks can treat the entire enterprise as his own (as long as he delivers the ships needed) and award contracts as he sees fit to his friends and cronies! Officials making profits from the government’s investment was an accepted cost of business and, provided the men were not too greedy, an assurance that they were looking after their interests and those of the navy!"	false

Life is hard in the mountains, and it is easier to take something than build, grow or make it. Banditry, feuds, revenge and murder are a way of life for many, and the survivors of this harsh school of life must be tough and uncompromising in their hating. All this means that they superb in war: deadly shots and dirty fighters. Any governor who tries to impose order rapidly finds that hill folk may fight each other, but they will always unite against the outsider.

Historically, many outside powers have tried to tame the wilder elements in Kurdish and Afghan society but with mixed results. Alexander the Great gave up, even after marrying a Bactrian woman, Roxana. In 1842, for example, a 15,000-strong British column decided to withdraw from Afghanistan back to India. Only one man actually made it back to “civilization” alive."	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1447626053	Your first priority should be to protect the boundaries of your empire to the north and west. Hostile Russia is attempting to obtain a Black Sea port through your protectorate the Crimean Khanate, and despite the recent peace, your traditional enemies the Austrian Empire will press home any advantage in the Balkan territories of Bosnia and Serbia. As the empire of Safavid Persia collapses there may be incursions into your territory from the eastern desert, so secure the borders of Mesopotamia and Armenia to keep their movement in check. You must also consider the steady advance of technology in the west - very soon you could find yourself disadvantaged on the battlefield, with only weight of numbers swinging in your favour. Keep abreast of technology by assigning scholars to research all the latest developments. Maintaining friendly relations with a major European power – possibly France – will prove useful should Russia and Austria rise against you. Continuing your support and control of the Crimean Khanate and surrounding regions should prevent Russia from breaking out of their present landlocked status, whilst the Barbary States should continue to act as a buffer to the aggressive navies of Catholic Venice and Spain.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_trading_company_european	"

Trading companies can be enormous, with fleets of armed merchant ships carrying all manner of cargoes. The successors to the medieval merchant adventurers, they generate fantastic wealth from their operations. Usually granted a government monopoly in either a geographic area or in a set of trade goods, the companies can also act as a privatised diplomatic service in distant corners of the globe. They are known to do deal with local potentates for trade concessions, military access, tax farming and they have taken over native governments by imposing their “advisors”.

Historically, the great East India companies of Britain, France and the Netherlands were armed, quasi-independent mercantile mini-states. The British East India Company was wealthy almost beyond imagining: its trade represented about one-sixth of the British national income. Like the French “Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales” and Dutch “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie”, the “John Company” had its own fleet and army. In India it fought wars and had its own foreign policy, giving the British government little choice but to support its actions. In modern times only petrochemical, mining and arms companies have commanded comparable power over nations."	false

events_event_text_michell_blackholes	"In a letter published by the Royal Society, geologist and natural philosopher John Michell has suggested the existence of a stellar phenomenon possessing the most extraordinary of properties. An object of such concentrated mass that even light itself would be unable to escape its gravitational field thus might be termed a ""dark star"" or even ""black hole"".

Since light is trapped within them these ""dark stars"" are effectively invisible, but Michell suggests that observing the motion of nearby stars affected by them would provide clues as to their location.

Sadly, no instruments capable of measuring all this yet exist due to technical restraints, but Michell hopes his ideas might eventually be tested through experiments in future years."	false

events_event_text_witchcraft_austria	"In a reflection of the more enlightened and tolerant times in which we live, Austria has removed from the statute books laws allowing the torture and execution by burning of those suspected of witchcraft.

In the last century, accusations of witchcraft were commonplace and those who found themselves accused were invariably hanged, often on the flimsiest of evidence and at the behest of a baying mob with their own agenda. The social, political and religious upheavals which beset the previous two hundred years are undoubtedly to blame for this - with the feckless, the superstitious, the vindictive and the unscrupulous able to persecute vulnerable persons and unchallenged by any centralised authority.

However, perhaps weary of turmoil, and under the steadying influence of reason, mankind finally appears to be coming to a realisation of the value of tolerance. Whilst the changes put in place in Austria do not condone those engaged in practices which might be construed as being witchcraft, they do go some way towards an acknowledgement that religious matters should not be so closely tied with those of state."	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1741193335	"This panel shows statistical information about the selected region. The bottom section shows the rate of and factors contributing to population growth; the middle section details how the wealth level of individual towns affects the region as a whole; the top section shows the status of public order, split into two classes.

Obedience to the system of government within a nation is measured in public order. If unhappiness begins to outweigh happiness and state repression at any point then the resultant unrest can lead to rebellion, if left unchecked. Keeping taxes at reasonable levels, and leaving troops as a garrison, will in most cases keep order in a region.

The grey pips in the public order section of this panel represent state repression - either from your government type, or via intimidation from garrisoned units. Whilst it is useful to keep the population in order, rebellion following a period of heavy repression can be difficult to suppress.

The overall happiness of a population is split between the ruling class and lower orders, with different factors contributing to the happiness level of each. Rebellion becomes a risk when part of the population is so unhappy that state repression can no longer contain public disorder. Always try to ensure that public order values remain positive!

Unhappiness is the first stage on the road to rebellion. At this stage the problem can be dealt with by an upgrade to the governor's building, or an increase in garrison size. Alternatively, taverns, conservatoriums, and related buildings will bring contentment to many, without having to resort to the sabre!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_canister_shot	"

Any cannon can be turned into a giant shotgun using the appropriate size of round. Normal cannon balls are terrible enough when they hit, but they will usually only kill or injure a few men. Canister is a short-range weapon, and used as a last-ditch defence against a massed attack. The slaughter inflicted on nearby enemies can be fearsome indeed. Usually, canister shots are made of tin, which serves to keep everything together while it is rammed down the barrel, but is no impediment to bursting effect. It is not uncommon for artillery crews to load a canister shot on top of a normal cannon ball, if they have time, to maximise the killing power.

Canister is still used by armies today, and has been refined over the years: beehive rounds used flechettes (small darts) rather than round shot, but the principle is the same. The 120mm main gun on the modern US M1 Abrams tank is capable of firing canister ammunition, making it a 60-tonne armoured shotgun!"	false

events_event_text_murder_most_horrid	"When a severed head was found in the Thames (and displayed on a spike at St Margaret’s churchyard in an effort to identify the unfortunate man), no one realised the full horror of the fate that had befallen him.

At least three people stepped forward to identify the man as John Hayes, a local coal merchant. When his wife Catherine was interviewed she insisted he was away on business, something his associate Mr Ashby did not believe - as he had been due to meet Hayes for business purposes and he had failed to show up. Ashby questioned Catherine himself, and when she told him that her husband had fled the country after committing a murder, he went straight to the authorities.

When constables paid a visit to Catherine at home they found her in bed with her lodger, Thomas Billings - who later turned out also to be her illegitimate son. They were both arrested along with Thomas Wood, a friend of Billings, who soon confessed to using his butchery skills to dismember the body of John Hayes. Wood insisted that he did not kill Hayes - implicating that Catherine Hayes and Billings had committed the murder.

It soon became apparent that, unsatisfied with the quality of life that her husband had provided for her, Hayes had paid Billings and Woods to get her husband blind drunk and then Billings had hit him several times with an axe, whilst Wood dismembered the body.

By this point, the remaining body parts had been found in a pond in Marylebone Fields, and wounds on the severed head seemed consistent with an axe attack. Catherine confessed, insisting that the devil was within them and it was he that had made the trio commit murder. All three were sentenced to death - the men to hang and be gibbetted, Catherine Hayes to be burned alive at the stake for petty treason in killing her lawful husband."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_socket_bayonet	"

The socket bayonet is a development of earlier bayonets, and corrects their defective methods of attaching the blade to the musket. Previous designs simply jammed the bayonet into the barrel or relied on a tight fit around the barrel. The socket bayonet has a collar with an L-shaped slot that fits over a lug on barrel, and then turns to lock it in place. The blade is also offset from the barrel centreline, so that a soldier can still fire and then reload his piece without cutting off his own fingers!

Historically, this improvement has stood the test of time. Socket bayonets are still issued for modern rifles and carbines, and still used in combat. The “twist and lock” mechanism is still used for civilian purposes as diverse light bulbs and vacuum cleaner tubes. There is, however, no really satisfactory explanation as to why the French military decided to offset the bayonet above the barrel, right into the sight line of the user!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_longitude_watch	"

While latitude is relatively easy to calculate for mariners, it is far harder to estimate longitude. Dead reckoning can put a ship many leagues out of position, making it incredibly risky to approach a possibly reef-strewn coast. Having a reliable “home” time, it is possible to compare local readings, and so calculate longitude.

In the 18th Century poor navigation was a dangerous issue. Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell (1650-1707) and 1400 others in his Royal Navy squadron died when a fleet went aground off the Scillies. Dead reckoning misplaced the fleet in a position of safety and, to add to navigators’ problems, no one could place the Scilly Islands on a map with any degree of accuracy either. Clearly, improvements were needed in navigational tools and the British Longitude Act of 1714 offered the immense fortune of £10,000 to anyone who could devise a method for successfully calculating that element of a position. English clockmaker John Harrison (1693-1776) did eventually produce a chronometer that kept very accurate time, but spent more effort in trying to get the money out of a recalcitrant government committee!"	false
technologies_long_description_industry_metal_natives_military_powder_making	"

The ability to create gunpowder means that a tribe no longer depends on supplies from fickle European traders. The tribe can therefore give muskets to more of its warriors, because they can be used, not just carried as clubs. Bullets are less of a problem, as they can be cast by any competent smith, and many gunpowder weapons come with bullet moulds as part of their accoutrements. But the availability of powder remains key: make that, and there are few limits to your power.

Gunpowder is actually a relatively simple compound, but one that takes time and skill to manufacture. Making the ideal mix is a matter of trial and error once the ingredients are understood, but grinding the powder to the right size takes steady nerves and real care. Powder for a handgun needs to have the right size grains if it is not to be too weak to fire a bullet or, worse still, burn too quickly and shatter the gun barrel. The user does not often survive such a disaster."	false

An army generates paperwork of all kinds, and a secretariat grows to keep it all in order. There is an obvious need to make sure that units receive orders and supplies in a timely manner – and without unscrupulous suppliers stealing too much money. Headquarters staff must also organise transport in co-operation with the navy, keep a list of officers and their commissions, organise parades to impress the great and the good, and offer assistance to the civil power in times of need. 

Historically, European armies were organised in an ad hoc fashion in the 18th Century. Usually, the biggest permanent formations in existence were regiments; armies were assembled as-and-when a crisis loomed under the command of favoured general. Even so, the concept of the central command telling colonels what to do with their regiments often met stiff opposition. The Ottoman and Mughal empires were better organised in theory, and did have larger permanent formations such as corps and divisions."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_american_heavy_frigate	"

American frigates are stronger than those built by other nations, both in terms of the punishment they can sustain and in weight of broadside. The two factors are related: the design includes diagonal bracing, and thick planking, allowing a ship of this type to mount 24-pounder cannons in place of the usual 12-pounders carried aboard frigates. This American frigate still has all the traditional virtues of the type. It is a good sailor, and can operate far from home waters. It outguns other frigates, but has the necessary speed to escape from larger battleships.
Historically, the reasons for creating a class of large frigates were strategically sound for the fledgling United States. There was, of course, no shortage of suitable timber in American yards on the eastern seaboard to make ships to this design. More importantly, however, the design recognised that America simply didn’t have the manpower to create a navy to the European model. She needed ships that used relatively small crews for the amount of havoc they could cause!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_carcass_shot	"

The shells are made by pouring an unpleasant cocktail of turpentine, tallow, resin, saltpetre, and sulphur and antimony compounds into a canvas sack, which is supported by iron interlocking hoops. The mixture hardens, and the shot can then be fired from mortars and howitzers. A weapon with a low muzzle velocity is required, otherwise the canvas rips apart and the crew are showered with the burning contents of the carcass. The hoops hopefully prevent the shot from bursting as it leaves the barrel, setting the users on fire rather than the target.

In theory, the mixture should burn for a few minutes when the shot bursts on impact, and be incredibly difficult to extinguish. Certainly, dousing the flames with water will have little effect. This makes carcass shot particularly useful against defensive positions, and an extremely unpleasant weapon when used against troops in the open."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_military_hospital_indian	"

Islamic and Indian medical doctors are among the best available and can draw on a long medical tradition when treating patients, often with more success than is found in using much-trumpeted “scientific” European methods. Unfortunately, they need all these skills against the many deadly diseases that are endemic to their homelands: malaria alone is a terrible problem and can destroy armies even more surely than defeat. On top of disease, the surgical problems of wounded men are compounded by the ever-present risks of gangrene and other infections. Even the simplest wound will quickly fester unless treated promptly and properly, especially in hot climates, and a wise administration makes sure that men have adequate medical facilities to hand.

Historically, armies in India and the Middle East were subject to terrible attrition thanks to disease, even those composed of natives to the area. Most men in the ranks died not from enemy action, but from a variety of illnesses brought on by poor sanitation, bad diet and poor housing. Invaders suffered even more, lacking as they did any kind of immunity to local endemic diseases."	false

Armed and equipped in the same fashion as line infantrymen with smoothbore muskets. They are, however, altogether more splendid fellows in uniforms cut from the finest cloth. Sartorial elegance is not the only mark of superiority, as these men are arrogant (with good reason), well trained, and terrifying soldiers. Any general is glad to have these men to hand, as they can be relied upon, unlike many line infantry units. They also make fearsome garrison troops as their loyalty to the throne makes them ruthless in suppressing dissent.

The Siemenovski Foot Guards were raised by Peter the Great (1682-1725) during his time at the Royal Lodge in Preobrazhenskoe. The Guard began as two Poteshyi companies Peter created to learn about the art of command. The Siemenovski Foot Guards proved themselves invaluable in Peter’s eyes, and further guard regiments were raised from among Russian nobles for years to come. The Guards were not just a military force: Peter used them as a political and administrative weapon. Officers were sent out to enforce Peter’s reforms across Russia."	false

Warriors dominate Native American society. They defend the tribes and earn renown while doing so. This gives them the status to become unchallenged chiefs and leaders in all aspects of tribal life. Hunting is also a fine preparation for war, as it teaches a man to be unafraid of bloodshed and danger.

Historically, the tribes used a wide variety of weapons for the hunt and warfare. Some were the same for both but others, like the war club, were of little use except when hunting other men. Traditionally carved from a single piece of hard wood, as the influence of Europeans grew, the war club came to imitate the shape of a rifle butt."	false
technologies_long_description_military_navy_lime_juice_and_sauerkraut	"

Scurvy is a terrible, disabling and ultimately fatal risk to all seafarers and many others. Most ship’s companies can expect to lose some of their number to its ravages. It begins mildly enough, with bad breath, bleeding gums, spots, and lays its victims low. Scurvy, however, is entirely avoidable if fresh fruit and vegetables are eaten. Failing that, the juice of limes can be stored aboard ships without losing its health-giving potency and sauerkraut (despite being pickled) can be a substitute for fresh cabbage.

In the 18th Century no one had the faintest idea that vitamin deficiency was the cause of scurvy, but a few clear thinkers recognised that something was missing from sailors’ food. Scottish naval physician James Lind (1716-1794) proved by systematic experimentation that fresh fruit was a cure for scurvy, possibly the first clinical trial ever conducted. He also advocated keeping ships clean and fumigated, and should be seen for all these as a hero of naval medicine for the improvement he made to the sailor’s lot."	false

Here, the feudal way of life has become so entrenched that the serfs are as tied to the land as cattle, and with almost as few rights. It is a vast, deeply conservative and religious country: Mother Russia and the Orthodox Church are the two pillars of national belief. The Tsar may be the father of his people, but by tradition and practice he is a stern parent. Ivan the Terrible was well named, and he has not been the only ruler with an iron will. Russia needs a strong hand controlling the “Third Rome”, the true home of Christianity (according to the Orthodox Church) after the fall of Byzantium.

Now, however, Russia is changing, awakening. It is beginning to look outwards, towards the best that the rest of the world has to offer in terms of ideas, culture and might. These things must be introduced carefully, to avoid the ills of free-thinking that beset some Western nations. When Russia does fully realise its strength, however, it will be formidable indeed. It has boundless resources to draw upon, and the steadfast courage of its people to bolster its armies. It can be a formidable foe, and a difficult one for an enemy to attack. One thing that Russia does have is endless space, and the lack of apparently defensible frontiers actually becomes a defence in itself. Invaders can be lured deep into the steppes, and left to the mercies of “General Winter” and Russia’s endless, empty lands.

To the west lies the wealth of Europe and access to the wider world through a port on the Baltic. That the troublesome Swedes are in the way is a bonus, for they will have to be crushed! To the south, there are fellow Slavs and Orthodox Christians in the Balkans to be incorporated into a Greater Russian empire. The infidel Turks have lands and wealth aplenty too, but possibly the strength to defend them.

And beyond, there is a wider world awaiting conquest by the sons of the Mother Russia."	false

start_pos_factions_description_51	"Prussia itself has only been “German” since the 13th Century, when the Teutonic Knights carved out a new Christian state on the Baltic coast. The present Kingdom of Prussia is a new state, the result of a union between the duchies of Brandenburg and Prussia, and it is a Kingdom only because the current ruler, Elector Frederick III has decided to improve his status to that of King! In doing so, however, he has been careful not to offend the Holy Roman Emperor, the Archduke of Austria, and calls himself the King “in” Prussia, not the King “of” Prussia. The form of words is a fig leaf: Frederick is King. And he is the king of a potentially powerful and influential Protestant nation, a centre of gravity within “the Germanies” for all those who would look elsewhere for a lead than Catholic Austria.

The Prussians believe – not without reason – that their virtues as a people can carry them through any trouble: martial discipline, sacrifice, a sense of order, but this sense of duty should not be confused with ignorance or intolerance, no matter what others may say. Prussians have always had to fight, but that has made them competent, not bloodthirsty. They have the potential to become a great continental power thanks to their martial traditions, many of which can be traced back to the Teutonic Knights. These could form the basis of a truly world-beating army. Under the right guidance, they could unite the German-speaking peoples into a single entity, dominate the Baltic and, perhaps, extend their reach far beyond the confines of Central Europe."	false

Indeed, the Spanish and Portuguese signed a treaty in 1494 that neatly divided the world between themselves. The Spanish went conquering “for God, Spain and to get rich”. They succeeded, to a great degree, in all three aims.

Spain is a staunchly Catholic country, and the Church and the fearsome Spanish Inquisition still have their hold over men’s hearts. This partly explains why, for all its wealth, Spain is economically backward: the Church sees usury (money lending) as sinful. This may be so, but this lack of credit does not help the merchant classes. Economic growth is also not helped when it is beneath the dignity of any hidalgo gentleman to earn money or work. But a gentleman’s honour is worth defending and a nation’s glory is worth winning, so courage is not in short supply. Indeed, Spain is blessed with courageous men on both land and sea.

That Spain will need defending, and soon, is self-evident to many.

Spain has suffered from his weakness of mind and government, but Charles cannot live forever. When he dies, what forces will shape the destiny of the Empire?

start_pos_factions_description_56	"Sweden dominates Scandinavia and the Baltic, a Northern European empire that is the legacy of the incomparable warrior-king, Gustavus II Adolphus. Even though he died in battle at Luetzen in 1632, the army that he created helped Sweden profit from the seemingly endless religious struggles of the Thirty Years War. The nation emerged from that conflict immeasurably stronger in military terms, and able to invade its Baltic neighbours at will. This military power did, however, cost money and Swedish lives. Neither of these commodities are available in abundance, and prudent stewardship has been necessary too. Charles XI, however, has left an impressive arsenal in place for his son, should he wish to take up the sword; and Charles XII has an obsessive interest in soldiering.

As the new century dawns, Sweden is a strong, aggressive state, surrounded by jealous rivals from whom she has taken territory in the last hundred years. To the east, the Russians would like unhindered access to the Baltic, and therefore Western Europe beyond. To the south, Poland-Lithuania wants its lost lands back. To the west, the other Scandinavian nations want independence or an end to Swedish domination of the Baltic.

In all these potential threats, however, lurk opportunities for those bold enough to seize the chance. Individually, Sweden’s rivals are not quite as threatening as they might appear: Russia is huge, that much is true, but incredibly backwards. There is no reason why the Baltic, as a Swedish “Mare Nostrum”, cannot become the basis of a new Northern, Protestant empire. Sweden’s armies are the equal of any in Europe, and her navy is not without resources and skill. With a home empire secured, who is to say that an overseas empire cannot be taken and held too?"	false

events_event_text_haydn_the_creation	"After watching performances of Handel’s ""Israel in Egypt"" during visits to England over the preceding ten years, noted composer Joseph Haydn has unveiled his own oratorio - majestically entitled ""The Creation"" - an enormous work reflecting the composer’s own piety.

Taking almost two years to complete, the deeply religious Haydn has never spent such a long time to complete a project, and following the premiere he collapsed with exhaustion, having run himself down during the composition stage.

The premiere was sponsored by a group of wealthy citizens who paid specially in order to hear The Creation’s first performance privately before it’s public debut. The chosen venue was Schwarzenberg Palace in Vienna, with admission by invite only - members of the public crowded the streets, straining to hear the piece.

Many of the privileged audience members have since written positive reviews of the piece, praising its pious and uplifting qualities."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_western_artillery_fort_european	"

An artillery fort has strong walls and parapets with embrasures: gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. Properly served and loaded with grape or canister shot, guns turn the approaches to the fort into death traps for any attacking infantry.

The fort has to be strongly constructed to withstand repeated pounding by attacking cannons, and by the recoil of its own pieces. Repeated firing by even small cannons, such as nine-pounders, causes tremendous strains on the structure. The other risk to the fort is, of course, fire. While the fabric of the building itself will not burn, the magazine holding the powder and shot for the fort can catch fire and explode.

Historically, it was not unknown for defenders to blow their own forts up, by accident or design. The powder magazine was a dangerous place, and required rigid adherence to correct procedures by everyone if disaster was to be avoided. On one occasion at Fort York, during the War of 1812, the defending British set off the magazine as they withdrew to deny the contents to the American attackers, killing hundreds of the assault force in the explosion."	false

The navy pays for doctors and surgeons to cure his infirmities; he has a bed in a clean ward; and best of all, he cannot spend his pay on drink and loose living. From the navy’s point of view, their men are returned to duty quickly and cannot desert or be “crimped” (pressed into service) by unscrupulous carers.

Historically, illness aboard ship could be a serious problem: “ship fever” (typhus) could destroy a crew more surely than a battle. It was traditional to put the sick ashore and leave them in the dubious care of lodging house and tavern owners. Death was the most likely outcome for the patient. The British Royal Navy constructed hospitals ashore to look after their sick and wounded; skilled seamen, it has to be said, were not easy to find, and taking good care of them made excellent sense. Better health care for sailors also came in small matters, such as the Royal Navy’s “portable soup”, a kind of dried beef stock that made a hot meal with the addition of hot water and a few vegetables. Good food aboard ship was as important as good doctoring ashore."	false

start_pos_factions_description_45	"The history of Europe over the last centuries can be seen as the history of the Ottoman Empire and a few annoying, small nations that thwarted Ottoman ambitions. Ottoman power is unmatched in its extent and grandeur, straddling the traditional trade route between Europe and Asia. The Ottomans also have power over the whole of the Mediterranean coast of North Africa.

This Turkish, Islamic empire supplanted the Orthodox Byzantine Empire in the 15th Century and since then it has had a continuing, if not always whole-hearted, ambition to expand further westwards into the heart of Europe. In living memory, Turkish armies have reached the gates of Vienna, Austria, only to be turned back by the steadfast defenders. Turkish expansionism has always been a part of palace politics: when a Sultan has felt secure at home he has attacked Europe; when a Sultan has felt threatened by his Janissary military commanders, he has sent them to attack.

The Ottomans face challenges but within these are great opportunities. The army and navy look old fashioned compared to those of some states, but the soldiers of the Sultan are numerous indeed. Strategically, the Empire is in a potentially strong position: the Balkans are a natural bastion to defend Istanbul, and a possible springboard for conquest into central Europe. There may even be valuable allies to be found among Austria’s rivals: the authority of the Pope to stop his European flock making treaties with infidels is all but gone. Control of the Mediterranean would allow a Sultan to do as he pleases with the smaller European powers. And to the east, the route to India offers the chance of riches."	false

start_pos_factions_description_49	"Poland is an old idea, and an old kingdom. Like anything old, it has old enmities and problems.

The problems, and enmities, are those of any state surrounded by ambitious rivals, all of whom are looking to become stronger at someone else’s expense. Sweden’s ambitions to create an empire around the Baltic; Tsar Peter’s desires to make Russia a great European power to rival the style of Bourbon France; the Austrians and Prussians each seeking to define a greater Germany and secure their borders; even the distant Ottomans have to be considered, should they ever launch a new assault on Christian Europe. And in the middle of all of this, a Polish-Lithuanian state that is not under the control of a single, strong ruler, a man who can impose his will to defend his people. Instead, Poland is something altogether stranger: a land where the people have a say in government.

That the country has survived at all is a tribute to the spirit of its people.

And yet, these rivalries could be turned to advantage. A Polish leader who picked his alliances carefully, and his wars equally so, could do much to make his country great. The Russians have no divine right to dominate the steppes, or the Swedes to control the Baltic. The various Germans states need allies, the same as other nations, and cannot expect to take anything they want without a struggle. A clever Polish leader could make much of this situation, if he can manage the hopes, expectations and fears of his people at home."	false

A “cottage industry” is literally that: one where whole families live and work in their cottages at the same craft. Once the whole community is engaged in the same trade, output can be relatively substantial, but limited by the skills of the workers. There is some division of labour involved: family women tend to be the yarn producers, while men operate the manual looms. From dusk to dawn, the machines have to work in order for families to survive: they are paid piecework rates, so must work quickly.

Historically, weaving was a substantial industry but entirely cottage-based before the rise of water and steam-powered mills in Yorkshire, England. Cloth and “piece” halls in market towns allowed the consolidation of bulk shipments from many small suppliers. The system, however, was incapable of producing goods of a consistent quality (as each weaver worked to his own standards), and could not be scaled to match demand. Artisans took years to master their trade, not the weeks it took to install a new machine in a powered mill."	false

Some places in the mortal world have a stronger connection to the spirit world than others. These are places where the spirits of the ancestors feel comfortable, places where men can talk with them and ask for their wisdom. 

Historically, the most famous example of these places is Black Hills of Dakota, a place believed to be the spiritual centre of the world. This hallowed land was respected by those who sought wisdom. Unfortunately, it was also the site of rich gold seam."	false

The horsemanship of many Native Americans is unparalleled. Able to wield any number of weapons on horseback, they are formidable foes. Perhaps their most deadly weapon from horseback is the lance. Often decorated with items to commemorate courageous acts performed by a warrior, eagle feathers traditionally mark a particularly ferocious man. 

The traditional lance used for hunting was found to be far too long for use in warfare, and a much shorter version was developed. The materials used to make a lance would depend on the areas a tribe inhabited, but the “business end” was made from flint, a material far sharper than many more “civilized” materials."	false

Militia or provincial troops are commonly held to be inferior to regular soldiers and, although they are trained to use the same tactics as marching regiments of the line, there is some truth in this assertion. Militia are expected to act as reassuring presence, and sometimes as a police force in suppressing local disturbances.

Historically, it was not unusual for militia to be locals recruited as part-time soldiers while retaining their day jobs and trades. In Britain, for example, service in the militia was seen as a good idea: you not only looked very patriotic for volunteering, but you could not be sent overseas! For ambitious would-be officers, there was a hidden financial benefit to joining the militia. A commander who could persuade his men to transfer to the army with him would not have to pay the cost of his regular commission."	false

Intimate pleasures are also available – at a price. The bathhouse staff, or “tellak”, help customers wash themselves, much as the slaves did in Roman and Byzantine baths centuries before. Incidentally, the Byzantine designs influenced the layout and processes of the Turkish bath. However, tellak are young men (never women) recruited from among the non-Muslim subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire, selected for their good looks and pliant ways. A visit to a Turkish bath can therefore be a purely hygienic exercise, an opportunity for gossip, or a chance to indulge a taste for depravity.

Historically, Turkish baths did become popular across Europe although not necessarily always as disguised bawdyhouses. By the Victorian period, they were a popular – and unimpeachable – adjunct to many gentlemen’s clubs and the better sort of hotel."	false

A sugar mill takes sugar cane and crushes it to extract the juice: when powered by steam, the crushing gears can extract much more juice from the plants. The juice is boiled down until it crystallizes as sugar of various grades. As might be imagined, the process is hot (especially in tropical climes) and dangerous to the workers: injuries from being dragged into the machinery are not uncommon.  

Milling improvements allowed more sugar cane to be processed, and make the whole process more efficient as well. Historically, even though European demand seemed to have no limits the price of sugar actually fell over time as manufacturing improved. A healthy trade in machine parts for mills also grew up between Europe and the sugar-growing regions."	false

This is a pure statement of the nation’s wealth and power. No expense is spared in order to give the monarch a suitable setting. Apart from the landscape itself, which is carefully ordered to banish wild nature and the lower orders, the palace itself is a magnificent structure, unrestrained by any budgetary constraints. This is a setting for balls, masques, intrigues and plots, all under the watchful eye of the monarch and his inner circle.

Versailles was probably the most magnificent example of this kind of palace. From the palace itself to the mock farm (complete with sheep washed in eau de cologne) for the Queen to play at being a shepherdess, no expense was spared. It was a very public projection of the wealth and prestige of the Bourbons and of France itself. The place was designed to overawe and confound lesser men with its sumptuous, sybaritic comforts."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_steam-pumped_land_drainage	"

There is always a growing demand for food and a finite amount of land where it can be grown. With new steam-powered pumping machines and cunningly laid out ditches, it becomes possible to drain land previously considered impossible to use. Water runs downhill, but where there is no “downhill”, it must be lifted and carried away by man’s artifice. A steam pump can raise water at a rate no animal- or man-powered contraption can possible match.

In Europe, the Dutch were (naturally enough, given their geography) the experts on drainage, using windmills to move water into higher channels were it could flow away. These, however, relied entirely on the wind. The steam-powered beam engine, used to drain mine workings, had no such weakness, and continued to pump as long as it had water and fuel. In Britain, the beam engine not only allowed the drainage of land, but also eased the problems of canal construction and routing."	false

Lavoisier conducted experiments inspired by the work of British scientist Joseph Priestley, who announced his discovery of ""dephlogisticated air"" three years prior. However, Lavoisier's concludes that the Phlogiston Theory of Combustion (postulating that all things are comprised of two types of matter: the true ""dephlogistic"" substance, and another ""phlogistic"" part given off when the substance is burnt) is in fact entirely incorrect.

More astounding still, the nobleman's investigations have proved that Priestley's dephlogisticated air is an entirely new element,  in fact comprising part of the air we breathe. Lavoisier has begun to refer to this ""vital"" air as ""oxygen""."	false

When fighting Europeans it is important that you do not fight in the same way – their drill and firepower are more advanced than your own, so you must use irregular tactics and make use of your ability to hide in plain sight if victory is to be secured. Beyond that, the Huron-Wyandot and Iroquois may provide your nation with new lands in which to flourish, but attacking the latter will undoubtedly cause conflict with Great Britain.

Freemasonry has thrived in Britain since the formation of the Grand Lodge in 1717, which bound the previously separate masonic lodges under a common constitution.

As trade and colonisation spreads, so has freemasonry, with provincial Grand Masters representing the Grand Lodge around the world. Some voices have raised concerns over charges of nepotism and other more potentially sinister influences, but as yet the authorities seem happy for freemasonry to exist and thrive in America.

Certainly its central tenets seem laudable enough: brotherly love, charity and truth. As long as its members continue to be guided only by these principles, freemasonry appears harmless enough to the majority - despite its mysterious rituals and bizarre regalia!"	false

start_pos_factions_description_63	"The Maratha Empire or Confederacy was born in violence, as the result of the successful overthrow of Mughal rule less than a generation ago. Raja (king) Shivaji managed to gain control of the Pune region, and from then Mughal power was no longer invincible. As might be expected, the Mughals and the Marathas still nurse a dislike for each other.

Unlike the foreign (in origin) Mughals, the Maratha rulers are Indian princes and kings. They know the value of the Indian way of doing things, of the age-old strength of their lands. Their armies may look old fashioned, possibly quaint to foreign eyes, but that makes them no less effective. The empire exists solely because it has the military strength to withstand the Mughal threat.

Perhaps now, though, it is time to think of expansion. It may no longer be enough to hold off the Mughals; perhaps they should be driven from India altogether, and a new empire with Indian rulers established. Perhaps only Indians truly have the ability to withstand the Europeans who are starting to demand much of India. For now, the Europeans want only money and trade, but soon they will be after concessions, a little piece of land here, another piece there, until all is ruled by foreigners from across the sea. Unless a strong hand guides India, it is possible that the rule of Mughal outsiders will be replaced by the lordship of European outsiders.

And perhaps, one day, a Maratha could demand concessions from a European, in his lands…"	false
start_pos_factions_description_1222428733	"The United States of America is a nation forged in the fires of revolution and rebellion against a British monarch seen as distant, foreign and tyrannical.

After the French and Indian Wars, the British government took an entirely unreasonable line: the American colonists should pay taxes to contribute to the navy and army that helped defend them. After all, those colonial fellows enjoyed the benefits of peace, protected by Britain’s expensive soldiers and sailors. The colonists had other views. The British responded with political stupidity and military ineptitude.

Aided, once they had rebelled, by the French Bourbons (who, for reasons of their own, had every wish to see Britain pre-occupied with war and then humiliated by seditious rebels), the Americans faced down Britain. The struggle split counties, cities, towns, even families, but it united the nation.

In its wake, the revolution left a new kind of nation, a republic where men choose their own destinies, and are not subject to the whims of kings. This spirit of independence is a source of strength: it is an idea worth defending! It is also a source of weakness, for Americans cherish the right to do as they think best. This is not necessarily a good thing in an army.

America now has a future of boundless possibilities. A continent stretches away to the West, and no one is entirely sure what is to be found there. The Atlantic swell washes against the eastern seaboard, and beckons American seamen onwards: trade and adventure lie that way too.

start_pos_factions_description_62	"Mughal power is mighty indeed, as befits the children of Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes. Their Indian empire has stood the test of time, and is possibly the wealthiest state in the whole world.

While the Mughal emperors are the descendants of Genghis Khan, their history has changed them. Now Muslim rather than pagan, they have also absorbed much of the language and high culture of Persia. Once India was conquered, they adopted much that is good from the local culture: the result is a rich and heady mixture of Indian, Persian and Mongol that produces an empire that is distinctive and Indian, both in the way it is run and the way it fights wars.

The Mughals are secure within their borders, although those borders are so extensive that even “local” problems can involve vast numbers of people. Their armies are, in poetic terms, numberless, and their power cannot be easily measured. Should he wish it, a Mughal ruler need only lift his finger to lay waste his enemies by the thousand. But why should he wish it? Why should he not?

There are potential problems, however. The ambitions of the Europeans may need to be checked, sooner or later. They seek power in India without any real understanding of what that means. They seek concessions, and land, and more concessions. At some point, a line must be drawn – or better still, a Mughal should make demands of a European, in Europe…"	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_wedge_formation	"

There are many conflicting schools of thought with regard to the proper use of cavalry, not least on the matter of how to attack the enemy. There are those officers who hold that fire is the proper weapon for a cavalry soldier: that the carbine and pistol are the correct weapons of a horseman. There are also those who maintain that the proper role of cavalry is to close with the enemy and attack them with cold steel: the sabre, sword and lance.

The wedge formation is a product of the second group of theorists. By forming units into a narrow wedge, a charge can bring the maximum weight of effort against the smallest possible section of an enemy line. In theory, the attack should be able to force its way into and then through the target, breaking it in the process and spreading chaos in the enemy ranks.

Historically, this tactic was not without its appeal to educated officers, who studied the military history of the Romans and Greeks. Alexander the Great had used such a tactic, and if it was good enough for him…"	false

events_event_text_bioelectricity_discovered	"The anatomist Luigi Galvani has become the first man to investigate the presence of electricity in the muscles of animals.

Whilst cutting a frog’s leg his assistant’s scalpel accidentally touched the copper hook the animal was hanging from. This resulted in a twitching of the muscles in the frog’s leg. Galvani was fascinated, soon discovering that simply touching the end of the scalpel to the nerve - with the other end touching the power source - was enough to cause the same involuntary movement in the dead frog. From this he has concluded that there is a relationship between the ""animal electricity"" flowing through animal bodies and the movement of their muscles."	false

These men are armed with carbines, and dead-eye shots, well used to using firearms to feed their kinfolk. They are equally adept at hunting men, both criminals and enemies. They can fight from horseback, or dismount and fight just as well as an ill-trained but courageous dragoon militia force. The ability to cover terrain quickly and then fight as best suits the ground makes them a relatively formidable threat.

The pioneers were almost forced to fight as dragoons of a sort rather than a proper cavalry force because of their available horses. Cavalry horses are expensive, highly trained and rare beasts on the frontier. A pioneer can, in moments of need, throw a blanket and saddle on his plough horse and ride it into battle. Of course, the loss of a horse is greater than just the loss of a transport. It can also mean starvation for a family as land goes unploughed or crops rot in the fields because they cannot be harvested."	false

They are organised into large hosts, each under the leadership of an ataman, or chief. Within each host, smaller Cossack bands fight as separate units. Traditionally, Cossacks are cavalrymen without peer, as might be expected of a steppe people, but they are equally adept at fighting on foot. They are personally brave, even headstrong, in the presence of enemies, something that can make them too eager to get into the fight.

Historically, Russians and other Eastern Europeans have had an ambiguous relationship with the Cossacks. There is admiration for their fighting qualities, yet a certain wariness of their wild nature. This has not stopped them being used as irregular troops by many nations. Even as late as the Second World War entire Cossack divisions were used by the Soviet Army, and then by the Germans who invaded Russia. Those Cossacks who served with the Germans (there were Cossack Waffen-SS divisions) were either killed in combat or captured and sent to die in labour camps."	false

events_event_text_global_circulation	"A scientific paper presented to the Royal Society by Mr George Hadley has explained a meteorological phenomenon upon which much of the world’s commerce relies.

The Trade Winds are generally reliable winds blowing steadily year-round in two distinct bands to the north and south of the equator separated by a zone of variable winds running along the equator known as the ""Doldrums"". By taking advantage of these winds, it is possible to circumnavigate the world in a westerly direction in a fairly predictable timeframe, making them ideal for use by the many trade vessels plying to and fro between hemispheres.

Until now, why the Trade Winds do not flow directly north or south has remained a mystery, since it might reasonably be expected that warm air would be forced away from the equator towards the colder poles. Hadley’s theory explains that the Earth’s rotation interferes with this process, producing winds trending towards the west and back towards the equator."	false

These men are chosen for one simple reason: they are all raving lunatics! Touched by God, they fear nothing, and will recklessly hurl themselves at any enemy until they are dead or there is nothing left to attack. Their wild-eyed appearance is enough to make even the bravest man draw back.

Historically, the Ottoman Empire is seen as a cruel state, willing to kidnap and use children in its military forces if necessary. The recruitment of madmen, then, is unusual to modern eyes, but not out of character. However, the word “lunatic” for the unfortunates in this unit may be a misunderstanding. The word “deli” has been translated as “mad”, but it may have been mad in the sense that the British army also use the term as an affectionate epithet, meaning ready for a fight, brave, “up for it” and heroic."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_seasoning	"

Seasoning takes time, as wood will dry out at its own pace once the tree has been felled and brought to a timber yard. Large sheds are required, where the timber can be left in dry conditions for a year or more until ready for use. Some, as it dries, will warp and prove unsuitable for further work. In the case of oak, the wood actually gains strength over time as it dries out and settles into its final form.

Historically, ships, and warships in particular, needed an enormous amount of timber, of many different kinds. It could take a century for a tree to grow large enough for use, so shipwrights needed to use their materials carefully. In an attempt to save money and timber, the British Royal Navy had a policy of recycling parts from old ships (which sounds commendably “green” nowadays) but this had the effect of transferring old rot to new builds. The French preferred to build ships out of unseasoned wood, maintaining that ships that had flexibility to “work” sailed better."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_library_european	"

Private collections of books have a long history, as do the large religious libraries associated with monasteries and retreats. Mostly these are collections of one-off and limited edition books, produced by scribes: rare, difficult to collect and very expensive.  

The arrival of accessible libraries is a direct result of the printing press. As soon as it became possible to print thousands of copies of a book, it was possible to create a relatively cheap and replaceable collection of books. 

Libraries rarely allow just anyone access. A subscription usually limits access to, in effect, the moneyed and propertied classes. There is, however, a “trickle down” effect as the autodidacts and dilettantes rarely resist passing on their new knowledge to others! While learning increases this is not without its risks to those in power: it is a series of short steps from reading to questioning matters than should not be questioned. Secondly, there is the risk that the reading public might have access to any kind of nonsensical revolutionary, heretical or just lewd rubbish! Think of the damage that could be done to vulnerable souls if a gentleman’s wife or servants were to get hold of such books!"	false
technologies_long_description_industry_textile_natives_government_improved_farming	"

European settlers have brought new crops of coffee, sugar cane, spices and wheat to cultivate; cattle, pigs, and sheep; and new iron tools. When combined with the native knowledge of the land, these new agricultural ideas can provide plentiful harvests to feed future generations, as long as the farmer maintains a healthy respect for the nature spirits, and does not try to exploit them.

Long before Europeans arrived, the Native Americans already had a long history of farming, including crops such as potatoes, tobacco, squash, cocoa, and beans. Slash-and-burn techniques were used to clear large areas, and crop locations were regularly moved to prevent over-farming. The Europeans introduced improved tools, new crops and a heavier emphasis on livestock. In parts of the New World the natives reared alpacas for wool and guinea pigs for food, but most of their meat came from hunting rather than rearing domesticated animals. Incidentally, the turkey is the only domesticated North American farm animal."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_maroon_rebels	"

Unless these people do fight, and fight hard, they face little mercy at the hands of their former owners. Their tactics are those of partisan underdogs the world over: strike from an unexpected direction, retreat in the face of a prepared enemy, and show or expect no mercy.

Historically, the word “maroon” is taken from the Spanish term for a Moor, a man of (North) African origin. The various colonising powers tried, with mixed success, to eliminate the maroons; the British even went so far as to sign a treaty with the maroons on Jamaica that guaranteed them land, as long as they captured and returned any new runaways. To modern eyes, there is a massive amount of hypocrisy on both sides to be found in this arrangement.

Some nations still have culturally-distinct Maroon populations, speaking their own creole languages (mixtures of existing languages to create something more than just a local dialect) and not having much contact with outsiders. Modern patterns of urbanisation are slowly dissolving these groups into the general population of each country."	false
battles_description_battle_of_the_chesapeake	"In 1781, during the American Revolutionary War, Lord Cornwallis led the British army to Yorktown during the summer campaign. His aim was to take advantage of British naval dominance to aid the campaign in the south.

A French fleet under the Comte de Grasse sailed from the West Indies to the Chesapeake, seeking to cut off Cornwallis from his naval support. It managed to avoid a British fleet under Rear-Admiral sir Samuel Hood. When Hood found no French ships at the Chesapeake, he sailed to New York where Read-Admiral Thomas Graves took control.

Sailing south they found de Grasses’ fleet in the Chesapeake. De Grasse took the approaching sails to be a friendly convoy, but it rapidly became clear it was the British fleet. Despite the advantage of the wind, Graves formed his fleet into a line allowing the French time to form into a line of their own.

Can you command the French and inflict enough damage on the British to inflict to force them to withdraw?

Historically the battle of the Chesapeake was a decisive victory for the French and their American allies. The British fleet did not suffer major damage, but its defeat spelt Cornwallis’ doom, and resulted in his surrender at Yorktown. This was the biggest blow to British operations in America during the war."	false

These light horsemen are often little more than mounted militia, but with a greater social standing. Cavalry always see themselves as better than footsoldiers, but in this case, it may be true. It is, after all, not cheap to purchase and maintain a decent horse, and this means that men with financial standing make up the majority of recruits.

They are, however, not as disciplined as regular cavalry, simply because they do not have the time or available resources to learn the craft of war as thoroughly. They are, however, extremely useful in policing the rougher, lower orders and keeping the existing social structure intact.

Historically, there are many examples of yeomanry or gendarmes turning on their own citizenry with surprising and horrific violence. They were widely used against the anti-factory Luddites in northern England and, most infamously, were responsible for the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, when the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry charged a mostly peaceful, but excited crowd, and cut down many unarmed protestors."	false

Men hunt to feed their families, their tribe. These skills are valuable, too, for the trade goods that they provide. Europeans will barter anything for furs. Therefore, any small improvement in the way the tribe conducts its hunts is welcome, and profitable.

Each tribe had tactics tuned to the surroundings and the animals they hunted. The Plains peoples perfected techniques for hunting bison: a band of warriors would scare the herd into a stampede towards a cliff. The animals would fall over the edge, being pushed over by their stampeding herd-mates. As a way of hunting, this was very effective, and very dangerous: warriors could be gouged to death if the stampede did not go as planned."	false

Despite the paltry level of his income, Johnson has already refused a sizeable cheque from Lord Chesterfield post-release - replying at length and objecting to his belated support.

However, as Johnson cannot glean further wealth from the book itself - the profits belonging entirely to the publisher - he has sold a collection of his ""Ramblings"" as a single volume, and already begun a new weekly column - and both seem to be doing well by the name of the author of the great dictionary.

Although several attempts have been made to produce a dictionary in the past, Johnson’s is the grandest in terms of the research undertaken and the quality and number of his definitions.

technologies_long_description_military_army_reoganised_procurement	"

Traditionally, the colonel of each regiment is responsible for making sure that his men are adequately clothed and shod, and carry weapons and ammunition to see them through a campaign. However, as armies increase in size military officers actually begin to compete with each other for scarce resources, and this only serves to drive up prices – and the profits of the unscrupulous and unpatriotic. It also turns the centralised co-ordination of, and sharing of, campaign supplies into an administrative tangle. It is true that it does not matter if an army has many types of shoes, as long as everyone has a pair. But something as seemingly simple as a common size of cannon ball can become problematic if every colonel of every regiment is allowed to organise and order his own weapons.

In addition to laying down standards for drill and military evolutions, during the 18th Century the army staffs of various nations (such as they were) also began to sort out the tangle of supply. The whole business was, in many nations, riddled with corruption and preferential treatment for friends, with bribes and kickbacks as well. While a certain amount of putting money into friends’ pockets was considered acceptable, there were limits."	false

Firing into the air in order to end the duel without harming a friend is now banned by the code, as fatal accidents had become a common occurrence."	false

This latest opus has been lauded throughout the literary world due to both its wit and commentary on the human condition. Before preparing his manuscript Voltaire was struck by the misfortunes suffered by mankind due to a number of natural disasters, and attempted to reflect the powerlessness of man and how little control a man has over his life.

The publication of Candide has groundbreakingly been achieved simultaneously in five countries, and he is already working on revising and improving the text for further editions - surely thereby achieving substantially more than the author’s modest aim to ""bring amusement to a small number of men of wit""."	false

It is possible for a skilled man to make parts for any device that are all of the same size and quality, but it is not easy for him to do this day in, day out. By using a series of machines that are set to carry an individual task each, it is possible to replicate the skills of the craftsman with unskilled labour. A man only needs to know how to place a work item in a machine and pull a lever. The machine itself will always drill the proper hole, cut a shape or turn an item. The main restriction on the number of any device made disappears, as skilled labour is only needed to set up the machines. As a secondary benefit it is also possible to standardise even the most basic of items, such nuts and bolts.

John Wilkinson (1728 – 1808), for example, created a new method of making cannons by casting them as a solid “lump” and then accurately boring out the barrel with a machine. His technique could also be applied to steam engine cylinders."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_over_1st_rate	"

This 120-gun (or larger) “first rate” is larger than a normal ship of that class, and far more powerful than a simple count of guns would imply. The ship carries 32-, 24- and 18-pounders on its decks, and wherever possible heavier guns replace the standard cannon found on a normal first rate. The result is a very expensive, very powerful, very prestigious warship, but one that can have limited utility. Few nations can afford the expense of building and crewing such a vessel, or can operate it far from shore facilities for very long. Its sailing qualities might be charitably described as “lubberly”: this is not a ship for chasing down enemies. All these drawbacks are secondary to its massive firepower and intimidating presence: this is a ship for dashing enemies to very small pieces!

Historically, only the Santísima Trinidad, a Spanish “super battleship” of four decks and some 136 guns, ever fought in action. Constructed as a three-decker she was enormous at 120 guns, even before her reworking. She fought at Cape St Vincent (1797) and Trafalgar (1805), and foundered after the latter battle in a storm while being towed away as a prize. The American USS Pennsylvania (ordered 1821; completed 1837) never saw action, and the US Navy destroyed her in 1860 to keep her out of Confederate hands."	false

start_pos_factions_description_31	"The history of Austria is one of warfare against invaders from the east, and the infidel Turks in particular. Originally, the Duchy was the eastern marches of the Holy Roman Empire (the Ostmark), and the defensive importance of Austria to the rest of Europe is immense. For nearly 250 years, the Ottoman Turks have hurled themselves against the bastion of Austria, reaching the gates of Vienna on more than one occasion. The last time was in 1683. Austrian bravery has kept them at bay, every time.

After the bloodletting of the last century – the Thirty Years War – within the Holy Roman Empire, Austria is a leading power among “the Germanies”. Leopold I, the ruling Hapsburg, has brought peace and prosperity, and maintained a first-class military machine (in particular, the Austrians have mastered the tactics of using light, irregular troops). This gives the Austrians the potential to become a truly great power, either within the borders of the old Empire, to the south in Italy, or to the east. This latter scheme requires the Turks to be persuaded – at sword point – that their destiny lies outside Europe. The Austrians also have much to be proud of in the arts, music and culture.

Beyond their immediate borders, there are other matters for the Hapsburgs to consider. The Spanish branch of the family is now close to extinction, as Charles II has failed to produce an heir, among his other problems. Perhaps Spain should remain a part of Hapsburg domains, but this might lead to confrontation with France. And then, of course, there are the pan-Slavic, Christian Orthodox ambitions of the Russian Tsar to consider…"	false

start_pos_factions_description_36	"France has had fifty years of military and administrative excellence under Louis XIV, the Sun King and his servants. They achieved this in spite of a backdrop of strife and rebellion sparked by France’s involvement in the Thirty Years War. Louis and his able ministers, Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, were able to steer France away from the feudal struggles that hampered growth, and they created a centralised government where the King’s power is absolute.

In 1700, France is the pre-eminent power in Western Europe, with an unrivalled army, vast colonies and a King who is respected and feared by all, both at home and abroad. Few nations pose any real threat to his well-equipped armies and heavily fortified borders.

The French Bourbon dynasty is strong, even though Louis XIV is aging. There are sons and relations aplenty, with legitimate claims to many titles. To the south, the lack of a Hapsburg heir in Spain – and the feeble-mindedness of Charles II – means that a Bourbon could one day rule in Madrid. A course of action that brings this about has much to recommend it. Of course, not all offshoots of the Hapsburg line are as weak as their Spanish cousins. The Austrian Habsburgs, and other European nations, may not be entirely willing to see a Frenchman or French nominee as King of Spain. No matter.

France is surrounded by possibilities, and beyond Europe there are other continents to conquer and colonise: New France in North America, and the riches of India. The untrustworthy British may have to be swept aside or crushed, but what is wrong with that?"	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_fire_and_advance	"

When using this evolution, infantry units do not advance as a solid mass, but divide into smaller groups, each of which then advances a short distance in turn. While a group is stationary, it loads and then discharges its muskets at the enemy, harassing them and covering the advance of their moving fellows. Overall, a unit advances more slowly because of the repeated stops made by its companies to fire, but the constant, though limited, fire maintained against the enemy is compensation enough.

This manoeuvre it demands a great deal of comradely loyalty from both officers and men, as each manoeuvring group relies on the fire of the other to keep the enemy at bay while it advances. Good discipline and weapons drill are also required, so that the stationary companies will always be ready to give fire when needed. Properly executed, it can be a devastating and effective way of closing with the enemy.

The tactic has remained in use to the present day as a method of advance called “bounding overwatch”, a particularly useful technique for armoured units where tanks give each other covering fire."	false

The Freemasons are a fraternal organization, sharing metaphysical views such as the existence of a Supreme Being, the importance of brotherly love, and truth and charity as a route to higher standards in life.

The secrecy surrounding their methods of recognition, the eccentricity of their internal hierarchy and rituals, and the mystery surrounding the movement’s origins have led some to unease about the true nature of Freemasonry and its aims. Could it be that the assimilation of the many smaller lodges into an overarching Grand Lodge is the first act of a power play to manipulate the fortunes of common men?"	false

start_pos_factions_description_29	"Great Britain is not a natural creation, but the marriage of separate kingdoms and peoples. The new nation has been through a century of unparalleled turbulence: an unwelcome joining of Scotland and England; religious strife; civil wars; an executed king; military dictatorship; a populist monarch restored; and the overthrow of a second king. Less than 15 years ago, the hated Catholic James II was forced into exile in the Glorious Revolution and a Protestant monarchy restored. A short, vicious war in Ireland put paid to any chance of a Catholic Stuart restoration. Nonetheless, the exiled James Stuart has sympathisers, the Jacobites, throughout Britain. Despite – or perhaps because of – this turbulent history, Britain is an engine driving the scientific and cultural advancement of northern Europe: turmoil fuels creativity.

As an island nation, Britons have always looked to, as Shakespeare puts it:

“…the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house…”

Britain’s strength lies at sea, but in trade and colonisation as much as naval power. Trade taxes pay for the navy; the navy allows unhindered trade. The English Channel keeps the French at bay and, to a lesser extent, the Dutch. With Dutchman William III on the British throne, there is ambivalence in the traditional rivalry with the Netherlands!

The English and Scots like to think that they can sleep safe, that no foreign invader or tyranny need worry them. They are partly right, but only as long as there is no centralised Continental power. A nation that can unite the resources of Europe will surely crush the dream of Albion. This, then, is the fundamental aim of Britain: to side with the weak in Europe against the strong – and steal as many overseas possessions as possible while doing it!"	false

start_pos_factions_description_2052555858	The Plains Nations are a loose confederacy of nomadic and village-dwelling tribes from the west of America, drawn together by their subsistence from the hunting of bison. Bison provide the tribes with almost everything: their culture is completely dependent upon them. The beasts are not just food, but also give clothes, tools, ornaments, and weapons. Until relatively recently the Plains people did not have a settled base, instead following the migrational patterns of the bison. This slow progress created the familiar “Tipi” dwelling, and they are horse masters without peer, thanks to the horses left behind by Spanish settlers. Unsurprisingly, the Spanish were not willing to share their equestrian skills with the natives they wished to subjugate. This led to hostility from both the Plains and Pueblo Nations. When the Spanish pulled back from New Mexico in 1680 they left many horses behind, and both tribal groups were quick to take advantage of this. The Plains Nations are generally unfriendly towards their fellow natives, maintaining just enough contact to boost their income through trade.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_small_coffee_plantation_tribal	"

Plantations can turn a large profit for their owners, providing the seasons are kind. The division of lands into small sections under a series of private owners means that profits can be made for personal gain. These profits can then be used to buy a plantation owner power and prestige within their society. As land-holding becomes concentrated in the hands of a few people, the chance for profit and for investment in those lands also grows. Income is not diluted into feeding many farmers and their families. 

With large plantations it also becomes practical to hold slaves on a larger scale. The slave trade was not something that was carried out only by Europeans. Many Native American tribes were also in the habit of keeping slaves – both bought from traders and captured in warfare – to work their lands."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_wooden_artillery_fort_european	"

An artillery fort has a strong wall and parapet that is set with embrasures, gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. 

The repeated firing of even quite small artillery pieces, even six-pounders, puts a tremendous strain on any structure. An artillery fort therefore requires a lot of timber for bracing, and a considerable amount of manual work to create the required earthworks. These do make the structure better able to resist bombardment by attackers, but no timber structure, even one backed by earthen banks, can stand forever against artillery. 

A wooden artillery fort commands the surrounding landscape, and is a significant strategic obstacle to any invading force. Its imposing walls also give notice that its builders intend to keep the land they have occupied."	false

Having sailed to the Indian Ocean, in 1748 she fought and was wounded eleven times in the legs and groin after being strafed by shot. Somehow she managed to avoid revealing her true gender to her colleagues until arriving back in London, where, with their encouragement, she sold her story to Robert Walker the publisher.

After approaching the Duke of Cumberland in St James's Park, and regaling him with her adventures, Hannah secured her army pension from the Royal Chelsea Hospital.

Now her story has been published as ""The Female Soldier"", leading to further public attention and appearances on the stage in her marine uniform. Now she rightly intends to retire to run a tavern called ""The Female Warrior"" no less!"	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_wealth_of_nations	"

This is a set of theories aimed at advancing political economy and promoting the pursuit of self-interest. The concept encourages people to consider the importance of the division of labour (so that productivity can be maximised) and the freedom of trade. Theorists state that all goods should be fairly priced and selling levels agreed mutually between buyers and sellers, with little outside influence from government or any other party.

Historically, “The Wealth of Nations” was a new and innovative piece of work written by Adam Smith, aimed at increasing the average reader’s understanding of economics. As one of the greatest minds of his time, Smith, along with a number of other great men created “Scottish Enlightenment.” Their influence was far reaching in the work of their contempories. Smith is widely held to be the father of modern economics"	false

Separating troops from civilians also allows better training and indoctrination. Regiments have the space to practice drill and instil discipline in their men. Civilians also have funny ideas, and it is often best if common soldiers do not learn of their freethinking and sometimes disloyal ways.

An encampment, however, does not necessarily look very military. Apart from the fact that soldiers could carry on their civilian trades to supplement their army wages, an army encampment would also be thronged with women and children. Soldiers’ wives were expected to look after their men: wash, cook, clean, sew uniforms, act as nurses and even help bury the dead! A cunning officer who managed “the baggage” well could effectively double the number of hands there were for fetching and carrying. Among the children, young boys could find employment as drummers and musicians from as young as ten years of age. Historically, it was not unknown for officers to enrol their own children (even babies!) as musicians, so that they gained seniority from the date they joined the army!"	false

Though it has a strong Christian element at its heart, the college’s charter is unique in its statement that ""any person of any religious denomination whatsoever"" may attend.

Though the first year’s students number only ten, and these attending classes in Mr Dickinson’s parlour, it is anticipated that the college will grow from strength to strength in the years to come."	false

events_event_text_smallpox_euro_inoculation	"Since the dawn of time smallpox has stalked mankind, killing one in three of those infected, and leaving many survivors permanently scarred, impotent or even blinded. Its victims in this century alone number countless millions.

The shadow of death has now receded from Europe in the light of wisdom from the east. Though originally treated with skepticism by the west, rumours that a preventative method used in India, China, parts of Africa, and now the Ottoman Empire have finally been proved correct. The process involves grinding the scabs from a smallpox victim's skin to a powder then blowing them up the recipient’s nose, or rubbing infected pus into a small skin lesion. Having endured a mild form of the disease, the patient will then enjoy immunity (or, just occasionally, an agonising death).

Despite some early reluctance, the process is now gaining in popularity in Europe. In Britain for instance, the royal family have all been inoculated. Any initial squeamishness they may have felt was overcome by the simple expedient of compelling several convicts to receive the treatment and observing, none of them having died, that it was probably safe to proceed."	false

For pioneers, day-to-day life can be a dangerous struggle. Cut off from outside supplies, not to mention luxuries from established towns, starvation is a constant threat. Farms enable pioneers to control food production and become independent, though many among the tribes are wary of the gradual encroachment of outsiders.

Pioneers introduced new farming techniques to the native tribes, advancing existing farming traditions by increasing yields. The planting of the ‘three sisters’ was an important aspect of this tradition, and a major food source for tribes. Squash, maize, and climbing beans were all planted in what is now called a 'complimentary planting’ sytem. The maize provided a frame for the beans to climb and the squash, by spreading across the ground, prevented weeds from competing with the food crops."	false

Pioneers raise cattle and sheep, bringing a trade to their wild frontier by creating valuable sources of food and trade. The tribe sells land and gains capital that way, but the change to ranching destroys the tribe’s peace with the Spirits.

The Spanish introduced ranching to America. The word comes from the Spanish “rancho” or small farm. Americans first practiced open-range ranching: livestock was allowed to roam freely and was then rounded up. Branding was used to distinguish cattle ownership, but as settlers arrived on the Plains the livestock became a nuisance, leading to rustling and the fencing of ranch land. Ranching eventually spread right across North America, becoming the basis of the “Wild West”."	false

Log cabins provide shelter and safety for pioneers as they migrate to the unexplored west. The pioneers live simple lives on civilization’s frontier, and these dwellings prove more than adequate for survival. However, the sale of land that intrinsically cannot be owned causes unrest amongst the tribal locals, and the gradual encroachment upon their way of life by strange European interlopers is worse. The sales provide funds for the further development of tribal society, but there are many who resent this loss of the old ways.

The perilous journey of the pioneer was undertaken by those seeking a new life. Upon arrival a suitable site for a cabin was chosen, and the land around would be cleared of vegetation. The cabins were relatively easy to build and used notches to slot the stacked log walls together. They could be insulated against the weather by stuffing the any gaps with sticks, rocks and a coating of mud."	false

An elite force, the zamindars are not particularly swift, but they are intimidating. Any foe that gets into close combat with them may suffer a severe mauling, and they can simply ride right over lighter cavalry, disorganised troops or infantry that has not formed square. They are, however, vulnerable to artillery bombardment and disciplined musketry; it would be wasteful indeed to commit them against infantry in square.

The zamindars were originally a class of almost-feudal tax farmers: men empowered to collect taxes from the peasantry. From being tax farmers, the zamindars slowly accumulated all the responsibilities and power of lesser aristocracy or gentry. The title itself is a Persian borrowing, and means “landholder”. The zamindars kept their holdings as long as taxes were forthcoming. Over the years, they became actual landowners, and gradually assumed military responsibilities as well. Some of these could be deferred by sending money, but it was also expected that these gentlemen should fight as irregulars for their overlords. The zamindar tax system survived even in areas ruled by Europeans; there was a “change of management” and a change to where the tax revenues were sent, but that was all."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_small_coffee_plantation_european	"

There are tremendous profits to be made in growing crops to satisfy the demand for luxury goods in Europe and elsewhere. There are also tremendous risks: crops may fail, slaves may revolt and, once a cargo is gathered, the ships carrying it home may sink! 

Plantations are labour-intensive, especially during harvest time. They would not necessarily be profitable without indentured or slave labour. Slaves are self-explanatory, but indentured labour was the result of the European taste for transporting convicted felons to their colonies. Once a criminal arrived, several years of forced or cheap labour would be imposed on him or her, and this indenture could be traded to a plantation owner. It was possible to buy out an indenture and become free, an option that was rarely available to slaves. 

Originally, the English word “plantation” was used to refer to any colony “planted” in a new location: even the Scottish settlers in Ulster were a plantation. There was no implication of farming one cash crop."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_monastery_school	"

The education offered is, of course, heavily weighted towards religious matters. The students will often become priests, so they must understand the creed and doctrine of the Orthodox Church and have the wisdom to act as guides and arbiters in their communities.

Historically, monasteries were not only retreats from the world, but the places where knowledge was preserved. The scriptoriums and libraries of monasteries kept and copied information from antiquity, while outside their walls life was nasty, brutish and violently short. Orthodox monasteries also had a long tradition of producing and preserving beautiful religious icons, and of performing liturgical music of an amazingly high quality."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_grenadiers	"

Explosive grenades are one of the oldest types of gunpowder weapon, and one of the most dangerous to use. Grenades are a simple cast iron ball, with a fuse sticking out of the top. Fuses are notoriously unreliable, and grenadiers can die as their own bombs explode prematurely. Yet no matter how terrifying grenades are for the throwers, they are infinitely worse for the targets! Grenadiers see themselves as elite, and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. They have good reason: only large, brave men become grenadiers, because it takes a big chap to throw one properly. Even their uniform makes them look bigger thanks to the pointed grenadier’s cap; a tricorne gets in the way of a good throw.

Historically, grenadier regiments and battalions began as ad hoc assault forces. All line infantry regiments had grenadier companies; collecting these sub-units gave commanders a useful group of heavily armed, aggressive and skilful soldiers. Grenadier companies remained in line infantry regiments after the creation of grenadier regiments, but they abandoned grenades. Instead, each grenadier company became a “heavy mob” of the biggest and strongest soldiers in a regiment."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_madrassa	"

These schools are often attached to mosques, but they do not offer religious instruction alone. Those who wish to do so may study the Qur’an, and become honoured as a “hafiz” when they have memorised the whole text. Others may choose a wider syllabus and learn additional subjects such as history, logic, shari’ah law, the Hadith – the recorded sayings and deeds of the Prophet, peace be upon him – and correct interpretation of the Qur’an. Those who finish their studies will gain status as scholars and imams, and become leaders in the wider community expected to interpret the law and religion for their fellow Muslims.
Historically, some madrassas offered their pupils an even wider choice of subjects, including Arabic literature, English, French, Dutch and other useful trade languages as well as science, mathematics and world history. The scholars produced were intellectually rounded individuals, often better prepared for later studies than the counterparts in Europe. There were even madrassas that specialised as medical schools."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_ottomans_nur-u_osmaniye_mosque	"

It is designed in a style that was extremely popular in the Ottoman Empire of the 1700s, and was ordered by Sultan Mahmud I in 1748. Unfortunately for him, it was only completed in the reign of Sultan Osman III in 1755, and is probably the most significant achievement of that particular sultan. The name of the mosque, “Light of Osman” commemorates his efforts in financing this superb, light, airy building with its many windows.

By most standards (even those of an 18th Century absolute monarch) Osman was a little odd. He was notably intolerant towards non-Muslims and generally regarded as a bit insignificant before he took the throne. He had lived much of his life within the palace as a prisoner. He loathed music, and banished every musician from his court. He also found the company of women extremely distasteful, having been imprisoned within the harem section of the palace. When he became Sultan he took to wearing iron shoes so that his approach would always be audible. Any women in the vicinity were expected to hear him coming, and then find somewhere to hide while he passed by. He was succeeded by Mustafa III, a better fellow and ruler by far."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_european_doctrine	"

The wholesale adoption of a completely new military model in troop types, drill, tactics, deployment, strategy, supply, fortifications and force organisation is a wrenching change for any Medieval or Renaissance-style army. The military “doctrine” of European powers is not so much a formalised approach to the business of making war, but a collection of practical solutions that have been found to work in many battles in many wars on many continents. From basic ideas such as the equipment carried by an infantryman, to sophisticated concepts of star fortifications, European methods have been forged in the crucible of war!

Historically, the Ottoman Empire had an army that was old fashioned, even in 1700. The “New Soldiers” of the janissary corps had ossified military thinking in a very conservative fashion, and intended to keep fighting as they had done for centuries. The rest of the world had moved on. A military treaty with Revolutionary France (a nation desperate for allies) began the process of updating the Ottomans’ “new model army”, based on then-current Western military thinking."	false

The bow is a tool as well as a weapon, used for providing food and defending the tribe. In the time it takes a musketeer to fire and reload, a skilled bowman can loose several arrows making them formidable enemies. Tribesmen hone their skills daily, hunting to provide food for their families and furs for trade with Europeans.

The materials used to make a bow vary from tribe to tribe. Some are made from wood, others from the horn of elks or mountain sheep. Bowstrings are sinew or rawhide but, in an example of using whatever is to hand, the Dakotas are reputed to use the necks of snapping turtles!"	false

Before long there was a stampede and a number of injuries, eventually leading to his arrest and a court appearance where he was charged with wearing ""a tall structure having a shiny luster calculated to frighten timid people"" and fined fifty pounds.

The Ojibwa Horse Warriors’ manoeuvrability makes it possible for them to cover large distances quickly and bear down on enemy threats beyond other units’ range. Wielding bows and tomahawks, the Ojibwa bombard foes with an assault that is both swift and terrible. They are an excellent force to counter skirmishers.

Historically, the Ojibwa were friendly with the French and fought alongside them against the British during the French-Indian Wars. Unfortunately, the Ojibwa had to deal with the British victors when the war was over. Rather than learning from the good relationships the French had built up, the British discouraged any camaraderie and ceased the annual tradition of gifts to the tribes. This provoked Pontiac’s Rebellion, an uprising consisting of many tribes, including the Ojibwa, under the Ottawa leader Pontiac."	false

Understanding of the land and centuries of hunting experience have taught Native Americans many techniques they can adapt for warfare. Europeans may frown upon these ambushes and see them as cowardly and skulking, but this is probably because they work! And what general likes to admit that he has been outwitted and outclassed by mere savages?

In 1755 the British general Edward Braddock fell foul of one of the most devastating ambushes of the French and Indian War. Sent to attack the French at Fort Duquesne, Braddock made a fatal error when he took his men through a narrow valley, and was ambushed by tribesmen and their French allies. A massacre ensued, Braddock was killed, and his force lost 900 men, along with many horses and provisions."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_sloop	"

The ability to navigate in exceptionally shallow or dangerous waters makes sloops very useful in such seas as the reef-strewn waters of the Caribbean. They can also operate without the need for extensive onshore naval facilities nearby. They are also extremely useful as fleet auxiliaries, carrying out communications tasks and vital inshore scouting work, and can hunt down smaller prey such as privateers and small enemy cargo vessels. A sloop-of-war (sometimes a corvette in French service) is a different vessel from a civilian, merchant sloop, having a flush deck, two square-rigged masts, guns, and a larger crew.

Historically, a post captain would rarely command a ship this small. The commanding officer was the “master and commander” (this is the origin of the modern naval rank of commander), and held the formal rank of lieutenant. Captain Cook RN commanded HMS Resolution, a sloop converted from a collier (coal ship), on his epic Pacific voyages and was highly satisfied with its performance. Sloop captains could be aggressive: before his promotion to post captain, Thomas Cochrane commanded the 14-gun HMS Speedy and managed to capture “El Gamo”, a Spanish xebec of 32 guns with a crew six times larger than his own!"	false

Company infantry are professional soldiers drawn exclusively from Europeans, both officers and other ranks. They are members of private armies for the traders, but one that is available to further national needs when required. They fight using European doctrine and equipment as line infantrymen, carrying smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets. These soldiers are also enforcers, tax gatherers and a potent threat against the local princes in India, even away from the battlefield. Native regiments under European officers exist too, but their reliability is doubtful.

Historically, the great European trading companies were often closer to being nations in their own right than business ventures. India was so wealthy that the companies needed armies, not just guards, to protect and expand their interests and prestige. The British East India Company (the “John Company”), the Dutch “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” (VOC) and the French “La Compagnie française des Indes orientales” all had their own armed forces; 1 in 5 VOC employees were soldiers!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_shrapnel_shot	"

Canister shells are intended to turn cannons into enormous shotguns or blunderbusses, treating men as so many targets to be shredded with musket balls. They have a limited range and utility.

The shrapnel explosive round, however, is a long range weapon, and has much in common with a mortar shell or hand grenade. Once loaded and the fuse lit, it is fired at the enemy with the intention of bursting like a mortar shell. Unlike a mortar, it does not rely solely on explosive power; there is the added refinement that the shell casing is designed to splinter into killing fragments and there are musket balls within. If a shrapnel shell bursts above an enemy unit, the casualties can be terrible indeed.

This deadly weapon was developed by the eponymous Henry Shrapnel (1761-1842), an officer in the British Royal Artillery. His “spherical case” shell was such an obvious advance in artillery killing power that he was rapidly promoted, given a generous state pension and immortalised by having his name become a new word for any kind of fragment deliberately built into a bomb or shell."	false

start_pos_factions_description_-698742140	The Cherokee are the largest and most powerful of the Native American Nations, yet their position remains a fragile one. As the campaign begins they are almost entirely surrounded by settlers from Europe. The Spanish occupy Florida and Louisiana to the south and west, and the United States lies to the north and east. Despite this proximity, the Cherokee have remained fairly isolated from their neighbours due to the mountainous topography of their homelands. They regularly trade with the United States, but are hostile to the expansionist Spanish, allowing other, smaller tribes to settle between them to create a buffer against any European expansion. Occasionally, tribal tensions erupt into violence, as the Cherokee are largely hostile to other peoples and are protective of their own interests. Maybe it is this suspicious nature and need to compete that has helped keep Cherokee population levels high throughout their turbulent history? Certainly, this approach has aided their rise to supremacy in this corner of America.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_steam-powered_cloth_mill_european	"

Profits from the mills can be enormous, as the machines run day and night, for as long as the steam engines have coal and water, and there are raw materials to process. Usually there is a central engine, and power for various machines is transferred by a series of axles and belt drives. Powered machinery is dangerous, and injuries among workers are common. This is particularly true among child workers, who are small enough to crawl beneath the looms and fix problems as they occur. It is all too easy to get caught in the whirling machinery and lose a limb, or worse.

Historically, workers saw steam power as a threat to their livelihoods. “Plug riots” where workers destroyed boiler plugs to render steam engines useless were common in Britain. The Luddite movement was so threatening that machine breaking was made a capital crime, and men were executed for it. The word French term “sabotage” originally referred to workers throwing their wooden sabots (shoes) into machinery to cause stoppages. The running of mills night and day did create jobs, but it also introduced the tyranny of obeying the clock through shift work."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_preserved_foods	"

A variety of preserving methods are used to aid the storage life of food. Meat and, to a lesser extent, cheese can be salted and stored for years, but the inevitable saltiness makes it a poor substitute for fresh food. Ship’s biscuits and flour for bread can be stored in barrels for long periods, but are notoriously prey to weevils. Beer likewise can be stored for a while thanks to the preservative effects of hops. Other foods are harder to keep fresh, and the solutions were to put into port regularly, carry animals for slaughter, or go without. It is, however, now possible to preserve food in jars or metal canisters: they are cooked in the container and then quickly sealed to keep out the air.

Historically, the process was pioneered by French confectioner Nicolas Appert (1749 - 1841). He spotted that food boiled in sealed containers only spoiled once the air was admitted, and earned himself a substantial prize once he went into production: a laborious business as each tin had to be hand made."	false

Barracks provide housing, armouries, and stabling for most types of troops, along with some space for the men to practice necessary military skills. They are usually also designed to be defensible, quite separately from any town walls, as a precaution against any local troubles. To that end, they often have a grim aspect, and dominate towns where they are found. From here, the governor can send men to defend his territory against enemies foreign and domestic, and the guardroom can even double as a prison for particularly troublesome local worthies.

Without a civilian police force in many countries, 18th Century governments were often forced to use troops for domestic purposes. Suppressing riots, keeping order and thief-taking were only part of their civilian support tasks. Soldiers would also be used to protect the property of the wealthy and, more importantly, to protect tax gatherers and their takings. This made soldiers a group apart from civilian society. Their popularity and acceptability were directly related their use against civilians, and the perceived threats from foreign nations."	false

events_event_text_south_sea_bubble	"The South Sea Company was formed in order to refinance copious war debts at a bargain rate of six percent, with exclusive trading rights in the South Seas.

Enamoured by the company’s lavish offices, and blinded by promises of a monopoly on trade with South America, investors bought as much stock as possible. Speculation began to spiral as ever greater numbers of shared were issued. Unfortunately, the company’s management were somewhat economical with the truth, lying to investors about the terms of trade, and encouraging all kinds of advantageous rumours to spread.

When they finally got around to chartering a trading voyage – six years after the company was formed – the management realised that the profits available bore no relation to the perceived value of the stock, and began to secretly sell their own interests.

Now word has spread that the management has sold out completely, panic selling has occurred  - in turn leading to an enormous stock market crash, the loss of many thousands of pounds, and the ruin of many individuals.

The government has stated its intention to stabilise matters, but the individuals responsible have fled to other countries to avoid prosecution."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_machined_rifling	"

Rifling in a barrel imparts a spin to a projectile, making it fly with greater accuracy once it leaves the barrel. Grooves are cut in a spiral helix pattern on the inner surface of the barrel, and this twist is what makes the bullet spin as it is fired. A lead bullet is actually distorted by the gunpowder explosion, and forced into the grooves.

Making such a barrel was a task for a highly skilled gunsmith, meaning that rifling was reserved for hunting rifles for the extremely wealthy and the nobility. A machine tool that can do the job means that rifled barrels can be turned out in some quantity, and that they will be the same time after time. The machine cuts one groove at a time, meaning that at least six or seven passes are required to properly rifle a barrel.

Historically, only the British fielded a large force of rifleman, armed with Ezekiel Baker’s outstanding weapon."	false

Their small horses can get them into and out of a fight with little trouble, making them well-suited to raiding tactics rather than a long, wearing fight. They are often positioned on the wings of an army, where they can rapidly take advantage of any isolated or vulnerable enemies. They are also superb at pursuing broken enemy units to prevent them reforming.

Historically, the Qizilbash tribes settled in northern Afghanistan and the middle of Mughal India. Their name derives from the Turkic for “Red Heads” due to their distinctive red headwear, which they kept even during their time under Safavid Persian rule."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_natives_military_improved_ironworking	"

Mastering the craft not only frees a tribe from relying on Europeans for iron goods, but also ensures a guaranteed supply of metal and weapons in times of trouble. The introduction of guns has dramatically altered warfare: the best way to keep pace is for a nation to own and control their own means of making firearms.

During the seventeenth century, many Native Americans became proficient gunsmiths, as metalworking skills became increasingly important, for both hunting and warfare. Owning a firearm was a mark of prestige for a warrior, and he would personalise his weapons with decorative beaded buckskin and brass studs. Damaged firearms could also be repaired, and barrels shortened to make them less cumbersome for use on horseback. It is a short step from such work to creating entire original arms."	false

events_event_text_encyclopaedia_britannica	"Many encyclopaedias have been published over the years, but it wasn’t until Ephraim Chambers’ two volume ""Cyclopedia"" of 1728 that publishers began to see the earning potential of such books.

The Encyclopaedia Britannica began as a reaction to the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot, which the authors thought was merely an apocryphal translation of Chambers' earlier works. Scotsmen Colin Macfarquhar, a printer and bookseller, and his partner the engraver Andrew Bell, thought that the time was right to rework the concept ""compiled upon a new plan"".

The young William Smellie was employed as editor for the sum of two hundred pounds, and set about constructing the epic opus. The encyclopaedia was released in weekly installments between 1768 and 1771, and finally bound in a single volume later that year.

Additionally, Bell produced one hundred and sixty engravings to sit alongside the written entries, even coming under some criticism for his depictions of body parts. Whereas content was liberally borrowed from many other sources, the stylistic innovation that set the Britannica apart from similar volumes was that related topics were grouped together - rather than alphabetically - so the reader could glean a greater knowledge of a subject than ever before."	false

Extracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.

It is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it."	false

start_pos_factions_description_-189154842	"France has had fifty years of military and administrative excellence under Louis XIV, the Sun King and his servants. They achieved this in spite of a backdrop of strife and rebellion sparked by France’s involvement in the Thirty Years War. Louis and his able ministers, Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, were able to steer France away from the feudal struggles that hampered growth, and they created a centralised government where the King’s power is absolute.

In 1700, France is the pre-eminent power in Western Europe, with an unrivalled army, vast colonies and a King who is respected and feared by all, both at home and abroad. Few nations pose any real threat to his well-equipped armies and heavily fortified borders.

The French Bourbon dynasty is strong, even though Louis XIV is aging. There are sons and relations aplenty, with legitimate claims to many titles. To the south, the lack of a Hapsburg heir in Spain – and the feeble-mindedness of Charles II – means that a Bourbon could one day rule in Madrid. A course of action that brings this about has much to recommend it. Of course, not all offshoots of the Hapsburg line are as weak as their Spanish cousins. The Austrian Habsburgs, and other European nations, may not be entirely willing to see a Frenchman or French nominee as King of Spain. No matter.

France is surrounded by possibilities, and beyond Europe there are other continents to conquer and colonise: New France in North America, and the riches of India. The untrustworthy British may have to be swept aside or crushed, but what is wrong with that?"	false

events_event_text_hellfire_club_irish	"Scandalous rumours are filtering through from Ireland regarding the Irish branch of the Hellfire Club. This loose association of individuals were formed from the highest echelons and formed by the Earl of Rosse, and hold meetings at a variety of taverns and clubs where they revel in debauchery and occult practices - Satanism having recently reached an unfortunate degree of popularity both in England and on the continent.

One member apparently killed a dwarf purely for the craic, another shot a waiter whilst dining and had the cost added to his bill! Due to their high status these men appear untouchable and no authorities have yet moved against them, despite obviously godless behaviour from members such as Richard Chapell Whaley. Known as ""Burn Chapell"" due to his habit of riding through the countryside on Sunday mornings setting alight the many thatched roof churches, Whaley also recently injured a footman who tripped over and spilled his brandy by pouring the bottle over him and setting him alight. The subsequent fire burned down the hunting lodge used as a venue for the club’s debauched activities!

Whaley’s behaviour is matched possibly only by that of his son Buck, an inveterate gambler who won ten thousand pounds by travelling to Jerusalem to play handball against the Wailing Wall, later moved to the Isle of Man with tons of earth to prove he could live abroad on Irish soil - and allegedly met the Devil himself one night in St Auden’s Church, Dublin!"	false

events_event_text_blackbeard_killed	"The vicious pirate Edward Teach - known to all as Blackbeard - has finally been defeated and killed in battle with the Royal Navy. Even though he had been pardoned under the recent Act of Grace, Blackbeard was still targeted as a dangerous freebooter by the Governor of Virginia - who commissioned two sloops under the command of Lieutenant Maynard to track him down.

Eventually finding Blackbeard’s ship in a North Carolina inlet, Maynard attacked Teach’s ship Adventure, giving chase as it attempted to cut anchor and escape. Managing to fire on Adventure’s rigging and forcing it ashore, Maynard ordered his crew below so that Blackbeard would board his sloop. As predicted, he took the bait and boarded with ten men, unprepared for the attack of Maynard’s men.

During the fighting, Blackbeard was cornered and eventually killed by blood loss from multiple sword blows and gunshot wounds. His head was later hacked off and hung from the bow of the sloop."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_four_field_crop_rotation	"

Simply: better soil means better harvests, and by grouping fields into fours, all crops are grown every year, just in different places. Farmers have long practiced crop rotation, leaving fields to lie fallow one year in every four to recover their fertility. This system works, but it means that a quarter of farmland is doing nothing every year. This reduces profits and food supply. Four-field rotation adds an extra, useful crop to the series that actually improves the soil: clover or turnips are typical plantings.

Viscount Charles “Turnip” Townshend (1674-1738), brought this Dutch invention to England, earning his nickname for his devotion to the crop and his exceedingly predictable dinner conversations on the subject. Despite the boredom of his dinner guests, his improvements worked, and were part of a larger agricultural change that further enriched the landed classes. In England, with the Enclosure Acts that effectively stole the common grazing lands of the rural community, crop rotation made the wealthy even wealthier."	false

The Fire Keepers are hardened warriors, honoured by the Iroquois. Thundering into battle armed with muskets and tomahawks, the Onondaga are useful for quickly reinforcing isolated units and taking on troublesome skirmishers. The fires of war burn bright in their souls and bellies!

As the Fire Keepers of the Iroquois Confederacy, the Onondaga were responsible for gathering the Grand Council of the Iroquois. They opened and closed the councils, and sanctioned the decisions arrived at by the Council chiefs. The Onondaga were also Keepers of the Wampum: the Wampum belts were historical records of the Iroquois’ traditions, rituals and events. Onondaga remains the capital of the Iroquois Confederacy to this day."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_theatre_european	"

A night at the theatre is a bawdy, rambunctious, rowdy, exciting, and novel experience. The theatre holds up a mirror to society, and sometimes society does not like what it sees. The audience show little respect, heckling is an art, and performers play to their claques rather than follow the text. Yet each great performance, each actor-manager, each new work, is eagerly followed by the chattering classes.

Historically, theatres could mean a great deal of trouble for the authorities. Riots were not uncommon if unpopular or provocative plays were staged, and David Garrick, the leading light of the London stage, was forced to kneel in apology before a fickle audience he had offended. They were in the process of completely wrecking his theatre and his livelihood! Because of this public excitability, and the potential for subversive propaganda, in the interests of “public morality” all governments closely monitored theatre performances. Indeed, Great Britain only scrapped censorship of theatres in 1968 when the Lord Chancellor’s Office no longer required London theatres to have approval for every production."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_iron_mine_tribal	"

Extracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.

It is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_army_encampment_indian	"

The lower ranks are usually housed in dormitory blocks, sometimes with their wives to act as servants and scullions. A substantial number of servants or slaves will be present to do much of the day-to-day labour when wives are barred. Officers receive better quarters, sometimes even their own houses, on the barracks’ grounds. 

The provincial barracks still have something of a prison air, however, as they are designed to keep unwilling troops in as much as unfriendly folk out. Impressment, even kidnapping, is not an uncommon way to get men into uniform. 

Historically, barracks were symbols of central control as well as housing for troops, particularly within the Mughal and Ottoman empires. The presence of large contingents of heavily armed men backed up the civil authority or even replaced it. However, within the Ottoman Empire the increasing use of military (and particularly the janissaries) as the government brought its own problems: these men were extremely conservative in outlook, fond of their own privileges, and unable to react well to changing circumstances."	false

campaigns_description_main_2	"The United States of America is a nation forged in the fires of revolution and rebellion against a British monarch seen as distant, foreign and tyrannical.

After the French and Indian Wars, the British government took an entirely unreasonable line: the American colonists should pay taxes to contribute to the navy and army that helped defend them. After all, those colonial fellows enjoyed the benefits of peace, protected by Britain’s expensive soldiers and sailors. The colonists had other views. The British responded with political stupidity and military ineptitude.

Aided, once they had rebelled, by the French Bourbons (who, for reasons of their own, had every wish to see Britain pre-occupied with war and then humiliated by seditious rebels), the Americans faced down Britain. The struggle split counties, cities, towns, even families, but it united the nation.

In its wake, the revolution left a new kind of nation, a republic where men choose their own destinies, and are not subject to the whims of kings. This spirit of independence is a source of strength: it is an idea worth defending! It is also a source of weakness, for Americans cherish the right to do as they think best. This is not necessarily a good thing in an army.

America now has a future of boundless possibilities. A continent stretches away to the West, and no one is entirely sure what is to be found there. The Atlantic swell washes against the eastern seaboard, and beckons American seamen onwards: trade and adventure lie that way too. There may still be scores to settle with the British in Canada, or ambitious nations from Europe to discourage. There is much to do, if this newest and boldest of nations is to survive and prosper!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_royal_observatory_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	"

The study of the heavens leads to advances in mathematics, and improvements in scientific instrument making, horology and, perhaps most importantly of all, navigation and surveying. Accurate star charts and lunar tables (showing the phases of the moon) enable sailors to determine their position at sea, and a navy that can navigate accurately is one that can carry out its duties effectively. An observatory is also a centre for national prestige, as discoveries made and published reflect well on the institute and the nation that funds its work.

Historically, observatories were vital in the development of navigation and accurate clocks. This is why the zero-degree longitude line passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London (until 1884 most states used their own nationalistic reference points). Indeed, the nationalism of astronomy often leads to ignorance of the observations and deductions of non-European astronomers.

Astronomers could also be outrageous flatterers. After he discovered what he thought was a new planet, Sir William Herschel chose the name “Georgium Sidus”, or George’s Star, in a transparent bit of sucking up to his patron, King George III. Other astronomers flirted with the name “Herschel” then settled on “Uranus” for the new planet."	false

These are spaces where rulers, their important functionaries, ambassadors and the “great and good” can take their ease, enjoying the peace of shade, running water, natural beauty, and pleasant scents.

The design of Persian gardens influences the layout of a charbagh (the word itself has Persian origins), and the plants that are grown. The central idea is to reflect or recreate Paradise in an earthly setting, albeit with the limitations that humans always bring to their works. The garden is divided into four sections, each with its own reflecting pools, formalised streams and fountains, and carefully selected plantings. Water features are important because they represent the four rivers of Paradise. The plants carry symbolic meanings too, for those educated enough to “read” the garden, such as the cypress trees representing death. Often verses of sacred texts are carved into the stonework, or inlaid in wall tiles, as a further aid to contemplation.

The most famous charbagh in existence is probably best known for the tomb it contains: laid out in 1632, the gardens of the Taj Mahal in Agra, are a superb formal setting for any building."	false

Skirmishers deploy as a screen ahead of the main battle line, usually as a widely spaced line of men. It is their job to harass the enemy line by peppering them with a few musket balls and scout for weaknesses. Most importantly, they must prevent the enemy from doing the same thing. They will not stop a serious enemy attack only delay it.

Advanced skirmishing requires a degree of intelligence from those in the ranks. They form small groups, spotting important targets in the enemy ranks and deliberately shooting them. For preference, enemy officers and sergeants are the main victims, as their loss causes confusion and doubt in the rank-and-file. Light infantry officers direct their men, rather than rigidly control them, leaving the brightest and best in the army to make their own kills.

Historically, light troops were hunters, poachers and the like, or the complete light companies from existing regiments gathered into a new unit. A few nations, such as Great Britain, chose to arm their elite skirmishers with rifles rather than smoothbore muskets."	false

The museum was the idea of Peter the Great, and was built facing his magnificent Winter Palace in the purpose-built “window on the west” of St. Petersburg. The collection has a morbid, even prurient air to it, as it features a huge number of “natural curiosities” in the form of human and animal foetuses and still-births, all carefully preserved so that their details can be studied. The point, however, wasn’t simply to collect odd items for the sake of collecting oddities. Peter the Great wished to debunk the superstitions and fears of Russia which, even though he was the tsar, he regarded as backwards and ignorant.

He had little interest in collecting man-made objects, unlike the hunters and collectors of antiquities at other great museums of the time. Major collections of minerals, rocks and scientific instruments were added to the Kunstkamera (a word derived from Dutch). The museum survived as a single collection for around a century, then its collections were despatched to a variety of Imperial museums."	false

They are armed with muskets and swords, and use both with equal skill and ruthlessness, as might be expected of men who are expected to use brigandage as a stratagem. They do not wear armour, as this would slow them down when moving across country, but they are able to use the same broken country to good effect when going to ground and hiding. If they are vulnerable in combat, it is when facing cavalry, as they lack the formal training to use square formation against mounted men.

Panduks are, in many ways, the Ottoman equivalent of Austrian pandours. Indeed, men might find themselves serving both sides during their lives. Pandours were irregulars, employed to act as brigands in attacking enemy lines of supply. The Bosnian panduks performed much the same duties, and were recruited from among ex-soldiers of many armies. It was quite possible to find men in their ranks that had once worn Austrian, Russian, and Ottoman uniforms. What united them was their Bosnian nationality: unlike other conquests in the Balkans, the Ottomans left the territorial extent of Bosnia unchanged. They wiped out the aristocracy, but left the people's sense of identity and place untouched."	false

events_event_text_bach_dies	"Johannes Sebastian Bach, the great composer, has died at the age of sixty-five.

His health had been in general decline for some time, to the extent where his employer - the Elector of Saxony - had already been searching for a replacement Kapellmeister from the burgomaster at Leipzig. Bach’s eyesight in particular had become very poor, and so the British Opthalmologist John Taylor attempted an operation to correct it - sadly during which the composer died.

Many in the press seem content to blame the surgeon for Bach’s death, whereas other more reasonable reports have suggested Bach was killed by a stroke brought on by the pneumonia he was known to suffer from. He leaves a body of work containing more than one thousand pieces."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_medium_galley	"

Although made obsolescent by the rise of broadside-firing sailing ships, galleys still have a place in naval warfare. The wind (or its lack) does not limit their movement and, if well handled, galleys can run rings around sailing ships. A galley has a reasonable amount of firepower for its size with cannons on a firing platform, or with a full gun deck above the rowers (on a design called a galleas). Up to five men work each oar; these are convicts (at best) or slaves (at worst). The life of a rower is hard, brutal and can be short: chained to their oars, they will go down with the galley if it founders. 

The galley’s main disadvantage is its vulnerability in heavy seas: it would almost certainly sink in a full Atlantic seaway. It is most useful in relatively calm waters such as the Mediterranean or Baltic. These smaller seas also help keep a galley close to port: the large crew size means that they cannot venture far from a supply port, making them unsuitable for trans-oceanic voyages. 

Historically, the galley survived for a long time as a practical warship in sheltered waters. The Ottomans, Swedes and Russians all used them in their battle fleets. As late as the 1790s they were still in use in the Baltic and the Mediterranean (C. S. Forrester has his famous fictional hero Captain Horatio Hornblower face Spanish galleons in one encounter). North African corsairs also used galleys, as they had a ready supply of European slaves to serve in them."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_military_syllabus	"

While gifted amateurism and the minor gentry’s natural leadership and impressive shouting can do wonders at regimental level, for higher level commands a military education is a necessity. There are matters of co-operation between the different arms of infantry, cavalry and artillery; there are considerations of supply, intelligence, military engineering, politics and grand strategy. These are not trivial subjects, and require some study if they are to be useful to a general officer. A military syllabus approaches these matters in an organised way, and sets out a programme of study for a gentleman to undertake. At the very least, the reading list will keep the less cerebral officers from attaining high rank!

The development of a system of military education aided the creation of a centralised army staff, as it produced the professional officers needed to carry out the necessary duties. In many countries, professionalism was often viewed with deep suspicion, because it challenged the idea of the nobility and propertied classes having an automatic right to command. Talent and proper training could trump the settled and natural order of things!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_water-powered_cloth_mill_european	"

The waterwheel is one of the oldest sources of motive power in the world. Watermills have been grinding flour since Classical times, and used to power tools for nearly as long. Ultimately, waterpower relies on gravity. Damming streams to make millponds to provide a head of water is futile unless the water is there in the first place; the expense is pointless if the mill itself is not a lot lower than the water supply. Steep-sided valleys and plentiful rain therefore determine where watermills are likely to be economically viable propositions.

Once the waterwheel is turning, it drives a series of axles. Individual machines take power by a pulley-and-leather-belt system. This limits the overall size of the mill, because a wheel can only drive a limited number of machines thanks to friction and the fundamental inefficiencies of a gearless drive. Thanks to few or no safety features – and leather strapping moving at high speed – a mill is a dangerous place to work. Any unlucky worker trapped by the machinery will be crippled or killed in seconds, and probably have their wages stopped for causing the mill owner to lose profits during the cleaning of blood and body parts."	false
events_event_text_halleys_comet_again	"A scientific prediction made by the former Astronomer Royal Professor Edmond Halley more than fifty years ago has been proved by the reappearance of a spectacular comet in the night sky.

In his 1705 work Synopsis Astronomia Cometicae, Professor Halley linked comet sightings from 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682 as being one and the same astral body, returning to our skies roughly every seventy six years.

Though he has been dead for more than a decade, the knowledge that the comet has now been christened ""Halley's Comet"" in his honour would no doubt be a cause of some satisfaction to the deceased gentleman."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_imperial_palace_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	"

All palaces are intended to overawe and intimidate those who seek an audience. The scale of everything is monumental and slightly inhuman, providing the ultimate stage for the public exercise of absolute power. This palace is the external realisation in marble and gold of the fundamental truth that here is a sovereign lord who has no limits: nothing is beyond his ambition. The entire resources of a state can be spent to create such a palace, if desired; if it costs a thousand lives, no matter. Within the walls, the palace is a world within a world, where official perquisites are jealously guarded and fought over, even as the officials scurry to carry out their master’s every wish.

Historically, buildings such as the Winter Palace in St Petersburg, Russia, and the High Porte, the private court of the Ottoman Sultans, were almost small towns in themselves. Their grandeur still inspires admiration and amazement, even today. From the Tsar and the Sultan downward, there was a strict hierarchy with everyone plotting and counter-plotting to keep or gain status. Even the servants “below stairs” had their own pecking order."	false

Sending Muslim missionaries throughout your territory will help to convert the population. This will in turn greatly improve the public order situation and reduce the chances of rebellion. European powers have begun to show interest in India for the trade wealth they know they can obtain. The Portuguese and Dutch already have a foothold on Indian soil, and the British and French are close behind them. It may be prudent to maintain trade with foreigners, to ally with one or the other for mutual benefit, or to drive them out of Mughal lands altogether.

Warriors cannot fight well in extreme weather conditions, and thick furs are the surest way to protect against the biting cold. Hunting skills directly aid the business of war, as plundered pelts will protect against unfriendly weather, much like they did for their original owners.

For the tribes of the Great Plains, buffalo were crucial to sustaining their way of life. Once a beast was killed, nothing was wasted: the bones made farming tools; the horns, cooking utensils; the bladder made a food bag; sinews could be used to string bows; even the poor creature’s scrotum could be turned into a rattle! Buffalo hide was used for clothes, and the beard and hair for decoration. The buffalo was not only a feast, but provided the cutlery, storage facilities for leftovers and a new cloak for the cooks!"	false

Cannon in garrison service are often mounted on very different carriages from field pieces, often resembling the trucks used aboard ship; cast iron carriages are also used. Garrison guns simply never have to be dragged across country, so the only purpose of the carriage is to help absorb recoil. The lack of mobility also means that large guns can be used and served with ammunition: again, it only has to come from a central magazine, not be carried across open country.

Life in a garrison was often seen as an easier option than going on campaign for artillerymen, and it was in comparison to living in camp in all weathers. However, garrison troops never had the chance to make an informal profit from their military service by looting, and promotions could be agonisingly slow. For the really unlucky, garrison life could be a death sentence too. Some parts of the world that needed defending were notoriously unhealthy. Being sent to defend some Caribbean islands was, in effect, an invitation to your own funeral!"	false

Cavalry units rarely stint themselves, and their barracks often have rather splendid mess facilities for the officers, who can hardly live in slums like common infantry riff-raff! Cavalry, of course, add style and dash to battles that would otherwise be vulgar brawls between grubby infantrymen. Thanks to this belief, cavalry regiments see themselves as superior in every way to everyone else in the army; even the private troopers share this arrogance. It is certainly true that cavalrymen are more expensive than other forces: not only have men to be found, trained, equipped and housed, but the same is true for the horses.

The military requirements for horseflesh were truly prodigious in the 18th Century. Finding sufficient mounts of the right quality was a constant problem for any cavalry commander, and may have been a contributory factor in the large numbers of dragoons in service. A cavalryman requires a good – for which read “expensive” – horse, because he and his mount are the weapon as they charge home; a dragoon can be mounted on any old nag, as his horse is primarily a means of transport. Providing it can carry him and his gear, it does not have to be stylish, or a thoroughbred."	false

As such, van der Capellen and his associates have become skillful in the ways of press manipulation and the use of satirical pamphlets to get their message across.

Now that the sea-change of revolution has gripped the world, van der Capellen has taken the opportunity to stir change within his own country, publishing ""To the People of the Netherlands"" in secret - a pamphlet highlighting the benefits of a more republican political structure, with a popular constitutional monarch at its head.

Although the pamphlet has been condemned by the Stadtholderate - of which high-born van der Capellen is technically still a member - it has proved most popular with the ordinary man, already reaching it’s third reprint! Meanwhile, the authorities have offered a substantial reward for information leading to the arrest of the author."	false

The Pindari are irregular force of men from many lands and social classes, united only by the fact that they are all Pindari. With an elected leadership and a disdain for military convention, they are not an easy force to control, but allowed to do a little looting, they can be a useful force of skirmishers.

Originally attached to the Maratha armies, these men were forced to turn to banditry for any kind of proper income. Not surprisingly, this proved to be more profitable and safer than large scale battle, and the Pindari have specialised in raiding ever since. If they must fight, though, they will, and with considerable skill."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_razee	"

Frigates are a vital part of any balanced sea-going fleet. They are cruisers that can operate independently and are swift enough to hunt down enemy merchantmen. The chance for prize money makes them popular postings among officers and men alike! 

One way of creating a large, powerful frigate is to take a two-deck ship of the line and, in effect, saw off the top deck creating a single-deck frigate. The first result is that a 64-gun ship can now only carry 44 guns, but the ones that remain are the heavier than those normally found on a frigate, typically 32- or 24-pounders rather than the expected 18s! The second result is that the razee retains the strong timbers of the original 64, making it a robust ship in combat. Thirdly, having lost its upper works, the new ship generally handles rather well under sail. All this work takes time and valuable dock space, of course. 

Historically, one of the most successful razees was HMS Indefatigable, commanded by Edward Pellew. In the company of another frigate, Pellew took on - and defeated - the Droits de l'Homme, a French 74, in 1797. During the next year or so, Pellew and the Indefatigable went on to take a further nine vessels."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_cheyenne_dog_soldiers	"

Cheyenne Dog Soldiers are master horsemen and use their skills to great effect. They  prefer to use their horses for swift transport rather than as war horses, dismounting to fight hand-to-hand. Dog Soldiers uphold an oath of unflinching bravery, and will stand fast even when the battle appears lost and all others have fled. They are ideal for a fast paced attack against a strategic enemy position where the enemy must retake the ground, and as a last line of defence when all hope is lost.

The Spanish conquistadores re-introduced the horse to the Americas (quite by accident), and the animals were soon adopted for war by the natives. They became integral in the day-to-day tasks of hunting and travelling across the plains, jobs which had previously been performed by dogs. Horses were so highly prized they even became trophies: warriors often had one horse that they prized above all others and used only for bison hunts. These horses were always tethered directly outside a warrior’s tipi, and were key targets for enemy raiding parties."	false

Increased contact with other cultures brings with it knowledge of written language: in trade and treaties, bargains struck with Europeans and others can be enforced. Not every man’s word can be trusted, and the ability to keep written contracts reveals any later trickery.

During the 18th century the Iroquois Confederacy was an ally to the British, fighting alongside them against the French and Huron tribes. The Mohawks created a system of writing for the Mohawk language, and provided education for their children. The Mohawk chief Joseph Brant was one of these students, and in 1772 he even translated the Gospel of Mark into the Mohawk language."	false

Bethesda, meaning ""House of Mercy"", is intended to offer a safe home environment for poor orphans, also providing them with vocational training, discipline, and a strong Gospel atmosphere. The children will learn trades that should enable them to find gainful employment in adult life - including agriculture and weaving.

Money for the five hundred acre site has been provided by private donations and the money Whitefield himself collects at his ever popular religious meetings.

However, Georgia is a difficult place for such a venture owing to its sparse population, yet Whitefield is a man of his word when it comes to spending the donations of others honourably, and is ploughing ahead with the project."	false

start_pos_factions_description_-630912304	The Huron-Wyandot, or “Wendat” in their own language, are four tribes who speak similar languages and occupy lands in the central northern part of the continent. Hardy trappers and traders, the Huron-Wyandot came into contact with French explorers in the early part of the seventeenth century, and forged an alliance based on trade. The chance to gain the upper hand over their hated Iroquois neighbours was also welcome. The French approached the Wendat as they were the least suspicious of European settlers and the most advanced traders, but by naming their new partners “Huron” meaning “ruffian”, they showed their true feelings of superiority. As allies of France, the Huron-Wyandot naturally became enemies of the British and the Thirteen Colonies, but they supported Great Britain during the American War of Independence. They realised that the United States intended to expand westwards into their territory. Now the smoke of battle has cleared, the Huron-Wyandot’s goals remain the same: destroy the Iroquois and keep the United States from taking their native lands!	false

As a result, these men are horse archers almost without peer, well able to use any ground to full effect. Even superior firepower may be of little use against them, as they have the speed to attack and then pull back out of range before it can be brought to bear.

Raiding has always been an important, even natural, part of the Navajo economy. This made many enemies for the Navajo among other tribes as well as European settlers.

After many years of Navajo raids, counter-raids and treaties, the United States government demanded the surrender of the Navajo. It was the adoption of a scorched-earth policy that starved the Navaho out of their homelands. In January 1864, many Navajos started what became known as the Long Walk, a journey to Fort Sumner. The overcrowded reservation contained ten thousand people inhabiting an area meant for five thousand. Four hundred of those were Mescalero Apaches, rivals of the Navajo. The Navajos were eventually allowed to return home, in 1868, finally completing their Long Walk."	false

Many colonies insist that settlers bring an arquebus and a set quantity of ammunition, along with other pioneering supplies.

The arquebus is a simple smooth-bore, heavy gunpowder long arm, fired by touching a smouldering match (a treated length of rope) to the touchhole. The rate of fire is slow, and the accuracy very poor, but massed ranks of arquebusiers firing volleys have long since replaced archers in armies throughout Europe.

To the natives in the New World, the thunderous sound and bright flashes spewing forth some invisible death struck terror in to the heart of the bravest warrior. It was not long, however, before commercial interest meant the colonists had sold gunpowder weapons to the natives."	false

events_event_text_species_planetarum	"The eminent Swedish naturalist Carl Linne - known as Linnaeus - has ensured a prominent place for himself as the ""father of modern taxonomy"" with the publication of his latest work ""Species Plantarum"".

This mighty two-volume work lists every known plant, classifying them according to class, order, genera and species - using Linnaeus' own unique system developed initially in his ""Systema Naturae"". His simple system counts the pistils and stamens of every plant to group them into genera, enabling easy identification. Formal names are assigned to each plant, along with shorter epithets for ease of reference.

Running to over twelve hundred pages, Species Plantarum is already a monumental work, yet Linnaeus intends to continually update and expand it as new specimens arrive from his many correspondents around the world.

Matters would appear to be (as the man himself has recently been heard to say): ""Deus creavit, Linnaeus disposuit"", or ""God created, Linnaeus organised""."	false

Line infantry are responsible for holding the line in battle, forming the backbone of the army while specialist troops harass and chip away at the enemy. Once the enemy is worn down, the regiment can rush them with a finishing bayonet charge. Their close formation gives them strength when attacking, but leaves them vulnerable to artillery and harassing skirmishers. If under threat from cavalry they can form a defensive square.

Historically, the Royal Deux-Ponts take their name from the Duke of Deux-Pont who raised the regiment on his German estates. The regiment served throughout the Seven Years War and remained active after the war, while many long-established French units were disbanded. It went on to serve as part of the French expeditionary force that arrived in America in 1780 under Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_engineer_school_european	"

The school teaches all the specialised skills that an officer of engineers will require, such as surveying, the use of explosives, military architecture, construction, the arts of siege warfare, military illustration (used to create maps) and much else besides. Some mundane tactical skills are taught as well, but engineers are not expected to command armies and issue orders to gentlemen. It is their lot to position guns and advise when a breach in a fortress’ walls is “practicable”, and could fall to an assault.

Sappers and miners, like artillery experts, had long history of being permanent retainers in royal armies of the medieval and Renaissance periods; siege works needed experts to demolish castle walls. Thanks to the likes of the French Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) and his magnificent fortifications, the need for military engineers to create, or break into, defences grew, not lessened, during the 18th Century. The elaborate and layered defences that he and his successors developed required skilled architects and builders. Engineer officers became a corps of highly educated experts, while leaving the hard, mucky work of digging to the rank-and-file sappers and pioneers, of course!"	false

Islamic law is quite strict in forbidding some food and drink for the faithful; intoxicating alcoholic drinks fall into this category. This is why coffee drinking has become a social activity, oiling the wheels of society without any of the risks, dangers and shame of public intoxication. The drink itself is a stimulant, and some conservative imams disapprove of it as a result but this has not prevented its general acceptance across all social classes. The coffee house has also become a place of entertainment too.

Historically, Middle Eastern rulers did not always regard coffee drinking as being a desirable pastime for the general population. Its stimulating effect was seen as somewhat suspect when the drink became wildly popular, although this is precisely what had made coffee popular with Sufis. When the drink reached Europe, coffee houses rapidly became popular. Some turned into business venues where financial deals were struck: the massive insurance business Lloyds of London started life as traders in a coffee house!"	false

Depression and hallucination are also common symptoms.

There have been several claims over the years by European scientists stating a link between scurvy and a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. The Royal Navy has only recently accepted this due to the efforts of one of its own surgeons, James Lind.

Lind has undertaken a clinical trial in order to prove his suggestion that putrefaction through scurvy can be remedied by the administration of acid supplements. In doing so, he has discovered that the sailors who recovered most satisfactorily were the ones fed on fruit - particularly citrus fruits such as lemons and limes.

It is hoped that these findings will soon be adopted as policy across all disciplines of the armed forces."	false

The styles and hidden allegorical meanings of poems take much time to master, and there is a rich set of traditions to draw on from all three languages.

Ottoman “divan” poetry uses Persian forms and many borrowed words (as Turkish does not suit Persian rhyming schemes). Arab poetry can be a great many styles, some of which need careful handling if they are not to offend religious sensibilities. Poetry can distract from proper Islamic studies, as well as praise God. A school of poetry teaches all of these nuances, and provides a grounding for those who wish to become court poets, a rewarding position for those who have talent.

Finding a patron is, of course, a matter for the individual students, and a good grasp of calligraphic styles can help too. Being literate and having a beautiful style of penmanship is truly something to be treasured."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_interchangeable_parts	"

Many devices are hand-built by craftsmen to extremely high standards, but this brings its own problems. If a designed component doesn’t fit into a machine, it can be carefully worked until it does; in itself, this is no bad thing, but the altered piece may not now fit into an apparently identical mechanism.

By making identical parts within a fine tolerance, identical machines can be built from any mixture of those parts. Work can be divided up amongst craftsmen, and broken parts can be replaced easily, even by a user! This is particularly useful for the military, as muskets and other equipment can be quickly repaired in the field rather than being thrown away or expensively rebuilt.

This advance became widely known about thanks to American inventor Eli Whitney (1765-1825). He built ten muskets in front of a US Congressional committee, took them to pieces, mixed up the parts, and rebuilt the muskets. The act was impressive, but he had cheated by having all his demonstration pieces carefully handcrafted to extremely exacting standards. He was largely copying the ideas of Frenchman Honoré Blanc."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_improved_animal_husbandry	"

Animal husbandry is, of course, a practical skill of every farmer, cowhand, shepherd, pigboy and egg collector on just about every farm in the world. It is, however, a matter of hard-won individual experience and folklore rather than rational, organised study. When gentlemen scholars apply their “scientific methods” of study to animals close to home, an improvement in animal care, health and breeding quality can result, leading in turn to greater yields for the farmers.

Historically, Thomas Coke, the 1st Earl of Leicester (1754-1842) was a leading light in this field in Europe. He reorganised his lands and home at the family seat, Holkam Hall. His “Holkam Sheerings” were gatherings of agriculturalists and gentleman farmers, who came to admire his flocks and herds - and see new ways of turning a profit. Many now see these as the forerunners of the traditional county and agricultural shows that take place to this day."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_dragoons	"

Horses give mobility, not shock value in combat. Dragoons do not charge home, but ride to critical spots on a battlefield where infantry firepower is needed. They carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets with shortened barrels (to make reloading easier) originally called “dragons” or dragoons; over time, this name transferred to the men.

Dragoons are also useful for riot control and civil suppression (“dragooning” is to bully people into a course of action). Their usefulness as infantry and “cheap” cavalry means that they can put down all kinds of trouble, as cutting down civilians is beneath the dignity of proper cavalry regiments.

Historically, dragoons slowly became cavalry soldiers like any other, and stopped fighting as mounted infantry, although many regiments did retain the name. The cavalry had always regarded them as (lower paid) social inferiors, and the infantry had resented them as not being proper footsloggers, so the dragoons welcomed their new acceptability."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_east_missile_cavalry_zamindari	"

The zamindars, or landholders, recruit troops from among the peasantry farming the lands they manage. A life in the ranks is a little better than one toiling in the fields, and offers the chance of loot and excitement.

At first sight, the zamindar system has much in common with the medieval “feudal” idea, and this was how many Europeans saw the system. A zamindar would be given land to run as a tax farm, squeezing the peasants for all the revenue he could get. At the same time, the zamindari would have a place in a formal hierarchy, and were expected to contribute a contingent of troops to the army. This sounds like the feudal idea of providing men to an overlord, but it was based on financial, not fealty, principles. There were even landholders who were expected to supply elephant troops rather than cavalry and footmen. When the European trading companies took over tax collection, they often left the local landholders to collect taxes, after weeding out the most glaringly corrupt."	false

A spirit circle is a centre of sacred power that has been blessed by a spiritual leader or Shaman. Entry to these circles is only from the east, and once inside the sacred dancers move round the circle in the same direction as the path of the sun through the sky.

Spirituality was, and still is, a deeply important aspect of Native American life. Many believed that there were three levels of spirit orders, the first being spirits on earth. Every being was said to have the power of the spirits within them. These were in turn controlled by the final level of spirits; those that oversee the whole universe."	false

events_event_text_calendar_changes	"For over five centuries 25th March - or Lady Day - has marked the beginning of the new year. Lady Day is a celebration of the Annunciation - when it was revealed by the Angel Gabriel that Mary would conceive the Christ child.

Upon its recent adoption of the Gregorian Calendar, Britain has controversially followed Catholic Europe's example and changed New Year's Day to January 1st - so now Easter will be celebrated around the anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea - and meaning that the British year now matches that of it's continental neighbours. Rumour has it that this change is also partly motivated by embarrassment, as having a calendar out of step with almost everyone else was causing problems for both traders and generals alike!

The upshot of this change is that the average man is suddenly concerned with the whereabouts of the ""missing"" eleven days he feels have been taken away from him, and the injustice of having his life unreasonably and inexplicably ""shortened"" against his will!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_mohawk_elite_warriors	"

The flexibility of Mohawk Elite Warriors makes them invaluable on the battlefield, and they can pepper an enemy at a distance with arrows then engage in close combat to break any survivors. The Mohawks are merciless in warfare and practice the collection of scalps for trophies, meaning enemies can expect a literally hair-raising death! Anybody who manages to avoid a scalping might be tortured before being burned at the stake, or, if very lucky, adopted into the clan as a replacement for a dead Mohawk.

Historically, many Native American tribes used furs and skins to trade with the European settlers. High demand forced the Mohawks into intensive hunting that soon depleted the beaver population in their area, leaving them with little to trade. In 1630 the Mohawks started the ‘Beaver Wars’, attacking other tribes and seizing control of the lucrative fur trade. Because of their loyalty to the British, the Mohawks concentrated their attacks on the tribes trading with the French, hurting their enemies and making a profit in the process."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_galleon	"

A galleon is a strong, seaworthy vessel, capable of surviving an Atlantic crossing in the worst of weathers. This is a tribute to their builder’s methods and techniques, learned over the decades of making caravels and carracks. The lines of a galleon show its medieval heritage, as the type is similar to the earlier ships, but without their high forecastle shape. The galleon retains a high stern castle, but its main fighting power is on the gun deck. This change meant that galleons are not fighting platforms for (land) troops, but fight with broadside batteries of demi-culverin cannons. In this respect, it is a forerunner to the later square-rigged rated ships of the line. The guns and strength of construction make them dangerous targets, as numerous English pirates and privateers discovered to their cost.

A galleon can also carry a substantial cargo. The Spanish galleon fleets carrying bullion from the New World, for example, made a tempting target because they were such good cargo vessels. The wealth they imported was almost beyond calculation. The gold and silver, however, damaged the Spain by flooding the country with “cheap” money, and there was no understanding of economics to help stop the problem."	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-324484024	Your first priorities as an island nation should be to ensure you have adequate naval defences in place, as a strong navy is the key to protecting your shores. Beyond that, maintain friendly relations with other Protestant nations such as the United Provinces, Hannover, Prussia and Sweden, as the ever-present threats from Catholic France and Spain may require a joint action by allies in the near future. In addition to securing your position at home, look to the preservation of your colonies in America and the Caribbean. France and Spain are always interested in expanding their overseas territories, and your colonists will provide easy pickings for less scrupulous nations - if left unprotected. There is also much unexploited territory in the Indian subcontinent - gain a foothold here before your rivals do. The once-mighty Mughal Empire is on the verge of falling apart, but it is still important to move swiftly. The up-and-coming Maratha Confederacy is ready to pounce and forge an empire of their own, so allying with them against the Mughals could be a useful strategy. It is especially vital to act in India before the French gain a foothold and begin to work against you as they have in America.	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_flintlock_cannon	"

Traditionally, cannons are fired by applying a slow-burning match to the touch hole in the breach. The primer catches, flashes into the main barrel, and the resulting explosion fires the projectile. The gun captain needs to be careful, stay out of the line of recoil, and keep his linstock away from any gunpowder. However, a burning match is not foolproof, and the method can produce misfires and, more dangerously, “hangfires” where the priming powder is burning, but has not – yet – set off the main charge.

By taking the flintlock from a standard musket and attaching it to a cannon breach, a reliable spark can be created, making firing a cannon a much more reliable process. Any risk of the slow match being extinguished, or causing an accidental explosion, is gone. The gun captain has only to cock the flintlock, stand well back, and then pull the lanyard to fire his gun. This certainty of fire is much valued aboard warships.

Historically, only the British Royal Navy and the US Continental Navy adapted the flintlock for use on cannons."	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_665527234	Your first priority should be to keep the fragile commonwealth together. There are many threats to its security from all sides: Prussia has imperial ambitions and desires to connect its fractured territory; Sweden and Russia are squaring up for war; while the Austrian Empire already controls much of the region and may expand eastward. It is unlikely that the territories of Poland-Lithuania will survive entirely unscathed, and your borders must be well-defended. Polish territory is also under threat from the south - Galicia & Podolia borders the Crimea, Belarus & Volhynia borders Russia. The Ottoman Empire may renew their quest for a greater European foothold. If so, there will inevitably be clashes with both Russia and Austria - so a wiley national leader could secure a Black Sea port from the Crimea. This would give Poland a clear line of trade to the Baltic and make it considerably richer in the process. It would also be sensible to ally with larger nations that may be able to assist Poland should her immediate neighbours attack - France, Britain, and Sweden are good candidates for trade and alliance partners.	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_percussion_cap	"

A percussion piece has less to go wrong than a flintlock during firing: there is no flint to become loose; no need to charge the pan with loose powder and less to get wet in bad weather. Instead a small cap is fitted over the end of a small tube at the breech end of the barrel. The cap is filled with fulminate of mercury, a most volatile substance. When it is struck by the hammer it explodes, but in a small way. The flash travels down the tube and ignites the main charge of gunpowder, and the musket fires.

Historically, the percussion cap was the invention of a Scottish clergyman, Alexander John Forsyth (1769-1843), who was looking for a solution to a hunting problem. The flintlock’s flash in the pan before the main charge fired alerted birds that they were about to be shot, causing them to fly away in a deucedly unsporting fashion. The newly discovered and very unstable fulminate of mercury gave him an invisible spark that didn’t warn his feathered victims!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_palestinian_auxiliaries	"

Palestinian auxiliaries would seem to be an oxymoron: high quality militia. In fact, they are extremely useful soldiers, perfectly capable of fighting  by delivering volley fire and in melee also. They are, however, outmatched by regular infantry with better training and equipment, and are vulnerable to cavalry attacks as they lack the discipline to form defensive squares. However, their policing abilities more than make up for any battlefield shortcomings.

Palestine is an ancient land, although it has rarely enjoyed independence from outside control. After the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516 the name disappeared from maps, and the area was referred to as the vilayet, or province, of Sayda, now Sidon in modern Lebanon. The idea of a Palestinian people, however, persisted. The Palestinians were loyal to the idea of the Ottoman Empire, and fought hard in its defence. Under Jezzar Pasha, Palestinians were among those who stubbornly held out at the Siege of Acre in 1799, forcing Napoleon Bonaparte and his French army to withdraw. This helped to bring his schemes of conquest in the Middle East to a halt."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_rifled_cannons	"

Ordinary naval cannons are smoothbore weapons, meaning that the barrel is a simple tube to contain the explosion. The limitations of casting mean that cannons are quite crude and windage, the gap between barrel and shot, is always a problem. A shot often “rattles” down the barrel when fired, making it inherently inaccurate. The loss of accuracy with a smoothbore makes its maximum range of academic interest only, simply because it becomes a matter of luck rather than judgement to hit anything far away!

A rifled cannon solves these problems. By using machines to bore out the barrel from a blank casting, one inaccuracy is removed. Another machine cuts a helical pattern of grooves into the barrel wall. This imparts a spin to any shot as it travels down the barrel, and a spinning projectile flies true. This makes the effective range of a rifled cannon shot much greater than one from a smoothbore, although the maximum range for both is similar.

Historically, rifled cannons used manufacturing techniques developed for making accurate steam pistons and cylinders."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_governors_palace_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	"

In an absolute monarchy, there is a great chain of authority that stretches down from the monarch’s person even to the lowliest of his subjects. Everyone has a place, sanctioned by time, custom and the approval of the monarch and no one is exempt from the awful majesty of the sovereign’s power. This is especially true of governors away from the royal court. They may rule from marble palaces, but they do so not in their own right but by authority granted from the Crown. If any of them ever forget that the grandeur and luxury that surround them are entirely borrowed, the penalties for personal aggrandisement are terrible indeed. Having been raised up, they have an awfully long way to fall.

In reality, many governor’s residences in absolute monarchies combined luxury (for who was to say when the king would visit?) with enough barracks and stables to house a small army. Absolutism always relied on the concepts of the “rod and the axe” to maintain authority, although by the 18th Century a good stock of gunpowder and a fine collection of artillery did better service."	false

By extension, heat is derived from the kinetic energy of gas molecules stimulated into rapid motion by a release of energy into the system.

Although the piece is rife with unreliable chronology, scant regard for the facts, and a degree of total fabrication, it remains useful as a unique record of the personalities and goings-on in the London theatres of the late seventeenth century.

Cibber, the son of an expatriate Danish sculptor, entered the theatre as a reaction against his parents' desire that he enter the clergy, and has developed a reputation for excellence in comedic roles, but is much-maligned as a tragic actor."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_4_inch_mortar	"

To the uneducated eye, a mortar looks like a large, stumpy cooking pot, set at an angle in a heavy wooden frame. Indeed, the weapon’s name may even have come from its similarity to the mortars used to grind spices. Mortars use indirect fire, firing their shells high into the air to plunge down on enemy positions. This makes them ideal for use in siege warfare.

Unlike a howitzer, a mortar uses a fixed, and relatively small, charge of gunpowder to propel its shell. Range is adjusted by changing the angle of fire; accuracy is subject to winds and weather, thanks to the flight path. There is also a practical minimum range to mortar fire: no artilleryman is going to drop a shell so close that he will be caught in the blast. Their size, expressed in terms of the diameter of shell they fire, indicates their destructiveness.

Mortars have returned to favour with armies since the First World War. Modern designs, based on the British Stokes trench mortar, come in many sizes. Most can fire shells with proximity fuses as anti-personnel rounds. The larger examples can fire sophisticated “smart” munitions that guide themselves onto targets."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_9_lber_land_cannon_(saker)	"

Artillery pieces are expensive to cast; as a result, they tend to be in service until captured, destroyed or rusted away. Sakers are a prime example of this, as many of the barrels date back to the 17th Century, even if they have been taken from dust-covered warehouses and mounted on refurbished carriages.

They are relatively light cannons in terms of the shot fired, which is much the same as a six-pounder. Some sakers are even old enough to have been intended for stone ammunition, and this is reflected in the fact that the windage (or difference between the barrel bore and shot size) is often quite large. This “rattling” of a shot down the barrel when it is fired does not help accuracy.

Despite the light weight of shot, sakers are anything but lightweight guns. Saker gun carriages are large, awkward and tactically immobile. Gunners and draft animals can drag them into place before a battle, but there is little chance of moving a gun to a better firing position once the action has commenced.

Although obsolescent, there were 14 sakers in the “Blenheim train” of artillery in 1704 available to the Duke of Marlborough – guns were expensive and he took what was available."	false

The state capitol of a republican province is the seat of government, a place where the people’s representatives can meet to pass local laws, appoint judges, and generally see to the good government of their region. At regional level government is usually divided into an upper and lower chamber, although both are elected. The regional governor himself may still be an appointee of the central government, a useful way of balancing local and national interests. All that said, little expense is spared on the capitol building itself, as this is a considerable source of pride and unity.

Despite the seemingly democratic nature of the system, there is no guarantee that anything approaching all the adult population will actually have a vote. Historically, the extension of the franchise to the popular majority is a late development in many democracies and republics. The US state of New Jersey, for example, allowed women the vote after the Revolution in 1775, only to take the right away in 1807!"	false

events_event_text_lucky_lucky_fellow	"Ludicrously fortunate American businessman Timothy Dexter has published an account of his amazing life, despite never learning to spell.

Dexter never went to  school, started by labouring on farms from the age of eight, and moved on to an apprenticeship as a leather dresser when he was sixteen. His career being successful, Dexter married and bought a large house before investing in European currencies when their value was low, subsequently making a fortune when their value increased. Investing the money in the construction of two ships, he started a business exporting goods to the West Indies and Europe.

Some of his bizarrely profitable lines were warming pans and stray cats to the Caribbean, coal to Newcastle, bibles to the East Indies, and mittens to Siberia! Dexter spent these profits on a larger house in New Hampshire and hired staff members, including his own personal idiot and poet laureate.

Now Timothy Dexter’s bizarre life has been recorded in his autobiography ""A Pickle for the Knowing Ones or Plain Truth in a Homespun Dress"", which must surely be a first as it contains no punctuation whatsoever, with capital letters strewn about randomly.

Giving it away free at first, Dexter has since realised the potential of his ""littel book"", and begun to improve it. The second edition contains an extra page containing all the punctuation marks known to him, for readers to ""peper and solt it as thay plese"". Further editions are planned!"	false

A college education is expensive, and there are few charity-funded places or scholarships for the less socially fortunate. It is a privileged man who goes to college: money or patronage are needed more than intellect. Although there is discussion and teaching of the radical ideas of science and philosophy to the students, the college masters are likely to have a conservative outlook. Most of the students are the same: they are from the top rungs of society’s ladder, and they have little interest in seeing the natural “status quo” altered.

Historically, attending college was probably the most boring element in the education of “young gentlemen”, although the actual work required was not that arduous. The “Grand Tour” became fashionable during the 18th Century, when the rich would wander Italy (Greece being an Ottoman possession), taking in the sites of Antiquity and the great works of the Renaissance. In the process they would spend a fortune on Classic-period statuary and relics, paintings by the great masters, and anything else that took their fancy. Quite reasonably, the less aesthetically refined, but well funded, would seek an exotic “education” in local taverns and bawdyhouses!"	false

Although they are an armed rabble at first sight, they have marksmanship skills honed by the need to put food in their children’s bellies. Their muskets might have seen use in bringing down quail or deer, but they are still capable of killing men. In hand-to-hand combat against the native tribes they have the disadvantages of all so-called civilized men, but with some native cunning as a result of living alongside the natives for so many years.

The colonial frontier required men to be self-reliant in all things, including defence. A man who could not take up arms to defend his homestead and family would soon find himself without both. Self-defence, however, was often extended to become a form of pre-emptive self-defence, as the colonial settlers banded together and, for want of a better term, went on the warpath against their tribal neighbours. Their logic was impeccable in its own terms, entirely driven by fear that the tribes would attack them if they did not attack first."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_spinning_mule	"

A clever contraption, the spinning mule is a hybrid of two other textile machines, the spinning jenny and the water frame, hence the term “mule”. It is a machine that produces thin, strong yarn at high speed, that can be used for both warp and woof on a loom. It is the answer to every mill owner’s prayers, giving both the quality and quantity needed to keep up with the demand for thread from powered looms.

The spinning mule was the invention of Samuel Crompton (1753-1827), an inventor from Lancashire in northern England, who was so hard up that he was forced to sell the rights for his invention before he patented it. This did not make him a rich man. Initially used for cotton, the mule was eventually adapted for other yarns such as wool. Crompton did eventually receive a grant from the British Parliament for his work to aid the textile industry; his attempts to run his own businesses were always less than sparkling."	false

Like many animals, elephants can be trained to ignore the sights, smells and, above all, hellish noises of a battlefield. They can also be trained to fight, goring men with their tusks and trampling others underfoot. Elephants make superb platforms for men to fight from, giving them an automatic height benefit over many opponents.

There are risks to using elephants in warfare. They do panic, and if they stampede they will cause terrible damage to everyone, friends and foe alike. Indian elephants, however, are relatively tractable beasts, and there is a long history of using them as beasts of burden. 

There is also a long history of using unusual animals in combat, from elephants to war dogs, and even seals and dolphins in more recent times. Elephants at least stand a chance of survival, unlike the Russian mine dogs of the Second World War, who were trained to look for their dinners under enemy tanks. This doesn’t sound too bad, until you learn that the dogs were carrying explosive packs on their backs. Dinner time on the battlefield was always terminal for the dog and his target tank."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_stockade_european	"

The walls are logs driven vertically into the ground and sharpened at the top to make a crude, thick fence. When defended properly this is enough to keep out most attackers.

This is the reason why a firing step for troops is usually constructed inside using either banked turf or earth rammed up against the logs. This banking has the additional benefit of giving some resilience against light artillery fire. A stockade cannot be expected to stand up to a serious pounding by cannons.

Historically, they were common on the American frontier where they were used as patrolling bases for contingents of light troops and local levies. Often in North America a crude stockade and the European flag fluttering above it were the only indication that you had arrived in “civilized” territory."	false

Tribal structure relies on everyone knowing his place and recognising where power is vested. The tribal sub-chiefs need a supreme leader to bring them together, to be a voice for the people. The High Chief fulfils this role, acting as father to his tribe with, if he is wise, the guidance of the medicine men and older warriors.

Historically, tribal leaders were the key in determining tribal policies, especially towards the invading Europeans. King Philip’s War of 1675-6 seems to have been the result of Metacomet (or “King Philip” as the English settlers called him) realising that trading tribal lands for goods was the height of folly, despite what previous leaders had done."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_poligars	"

They generally wear helmets and cuirasses, often of the highest quality; Indian weapon makers need acknowledge few equals. They carry swords, and have skill enough to use them well in melee. Poligars also have the speed to ride down light troops such as skirmishers, and to pursue broken enemies. They should not be thrown away attacking disciplined infantry in square: they require luck to break such a target.

Light cavalry were a fixed tradition of war in India, romanticised for their bravery and freebooting ways. Horsemanship was a prized and honoured skill throughout Indian society, as was fighting prowess. To make the most of both, Indian craftsmen produced some fascinating weapons, many of which were still in use in the 18th Century. The “patta”, for example, was a gauntlet-sword: a blade built into an armoured glove, making it almost impossible for the user to be disarmed, other than by being literally “disarmed” and maimed. It had a horizontal grip like the Indian punch-dagger, something that looked like a Chicago gangster’s brass knuckles crossed with a razor-sharp triangular knife."	false

Protecting family and land is the first responsibility for a young warrior. Learning weapon skills during the hunt gives a man the skills of a fighter; learning to fight alongside others makes him a useful warrior, and a credit to his tribe. 

Historically, warriors used the bow and arrow with astounding skill, thanks to constant hunting. Other daily tools such as the hatchet-like tomahawk were useful in war too. Oddly, in some tribes it was the custom to bury tomahawks once a war was ended (hence “bury the hatchet”). The tribes, however, never developed an organised approach to warfare to match that of the European invaders."	false

When inside an army the Scout extends its line of sight, and whilst he is inside a rival force their position and contents will remain visible to you at all times. He can also sabotage their ability to move during that turn, effectively sending them on a wild goose chase. Scouts can also assassinate characters and infiltrate or sabotage buildings.	false

events_event_text_wesley_converted	"The activities of a non-conforming minister are attracting attention in British society.

John Wesley is the son of a minister in the Church of England, and followed in his father’s footsteps by attending Christ Church College in Oxford. In the course of time he was ordained as a deacon and served in his father’s church before returning to Oxford to continue his studies. Wesley became a member of a religious group known as the ""Holy Club"", whose members came to be known as Methodists, before travelling to America to minister to both colonists and natives.

Although unhappy abroad, there was a positive aspect in that Wesley came into contact with the Moravian reformist sect - and he pursued this connection upon his return to England. Wesley’s own ideas about religious reform gradually took shape, and he has commented that whilst listening to Moravian sermons ""I felt my heart strangely warmed"".

With his faith redoubled, Wesley has begun to preach sermons on salvation and grace, often outdoors to huge crowds as conforming churches closed their doors to him."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_major_fishery_european	"

Life for a fisherman is hard, with months at sea in harsh conditions chasing the shoals. Ashore, there are as many people working to exploit the catch. Apart from the craftsmen directly involved in ship and boat building, chandlers, net weavers, and the like, there are also smokehouse operators, coopers, salt merchants, shippers – and, in some parts of the world, the inevitable press gangs looking for experienced sailors.

Historically, hunting the largest “fish” of all – whales – was extremely profitable and, depending on the species, highly dangerous. Whalers used hand-thrown harpoons, often from large rowing boats launched from a mother ship. A wounded whale could easily destroy its hunters’ flimsy craft. Again depending on the type, whales were taken for their meat, whalebone (baleen, the “comb” used to filter out plankton when feeding) and their blubber, which was rendered down into whale oil (actually a kind of runny wax) used in lighting, cosmetics and industry."	false

events_event_text_transit_of_venus	"Scientific expeditions have set out from many nations to observe the transit of Venus, a rare phenomenon in which the second planet passes in front of the Sun.

Such transits occur in pairs separated by eight years, and more than a century apart. They are an incredible opportunity to better inform ourselves about the motions of the celestial bodies, and, with such a scheme from the late Edmond Halley, scientists hope to pool their data to more exactly measure the distance of the Sun from the Earth.

Though many of the expeditions are still returning from far-flung corners of the globe - their data unpublished - Mikhail Lomonosov has announced from his St Petersburg Observatory an exciting discovery of his own. Lomonosov observed a bright outline around Venus at the beginning and end of its transit, and has attributed it to the presence of an atmosphere around the planet which refracted the Sun’s rays to create the observed outline.

Further expeditions are planned for the 1769 transit, and this unprecedented collaborative effort by the scientific nations of Europe will surely lead to new and astounding revelations!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pleasure_gardens_european	"

Public gardens are for the enjoyment of the leisured classes, and this usually means the moneyed classes. The chance to wander through a carefully tended landscape, enjoy a rural idyll and, possibly, a fashionable “pique-nique” while being seen by one’s peers is definitely a pleasure of the rich.

Historically, pleasure gardens often catered to a wide clientele, not all of whom came to enjoy the flowers. Visitors who stayed after dark could enjoy entertainments of a very non-horticultural, though similarly earthy, nature. The character of the gardens changed as night fell: they became the haunt of prostitutes, gamblers, mollies and the foully debauched. Vauxhall Gardens in London, for example, were notorious as playgrounds of vice and disgusting iniquity, where a meal, a whore (of any kind) and a drunken evening of sin were available to anyone with sufficient funds, if they could avoid a mugging. The elaborate theatricals and fireworks staged at Vauxhall were merely a bonus for watching revellers!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_gunnery_school_european	"

Gunners see themselves as a “race apart” from army officers, and with good reason. They are skilled specialists who have spent years studying their trade. In the wrong hands, cannons can be as dangerous to their users as to the enemy, so gunners are actually expected to know what they are about. Unlike army officers, who have often obtained their rank through the purchase of a commission, gunners are promoted on seniority and merit. It is not enough to stand around looking brave; a gunner needs to understand military surveying and drawing, mathematics, ballistics, some military engineering, and have a grasp of technical matters. This can create tensions between “gentlemen” officers and the gunners practicing “a trade”.

Historically, many corps of artillery and gunnery schools are older than national standing armies, as they can date their foundations back to the times when a Master of Ordnance or Artillery was part of a royal household. The most famous artillery student is, of course, Napoleon Bonaparte; his interest was considered surprising given his background as a member of the minor nobility."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_4th_rate	"

Ships of the line of battle are the mainstay of fighting fleets: strong and stable gun platforms for battering enemy vessels into submission. The designation of “fourth rate” for ships of this size is a British Royal Navy one, and covers a number of designs, all with very similar handling and combat power. All fourth rates are square-rigged, two-deck ships, with up to 60 guns on board in a mixture of calibres: usually a mixture of 24-, 18- and 12-pounders, with the heavier guns mounted on the lower deck.

Even though fourth rates are obviously smaller than the third-rate 74s, their firepower is much lower than a simple number-of-guns comparison would indicate. There is no structural strength or space for coping with the recoil of massive guns. As a result, a fourth rate may only have half the weight of fire of a larger ship, although partially it makes up for this by being a handier sailing vessel, especially in shallow waters.

Historically, it was obvious by the 1750s that ships of this size were not tough enough to stand in the line of battle against larger vessels. Over time, various admiralties removed these smaller battle ships from the active service, or sent them to minor stations where they were unlikely to encounter powerful enemies. Some survived as converted transports."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_5th_rate	"

“Fifth rate” is a Royal Navy term for the largest of the single-deck frigates, square-rigged ships that carry some 44 guns, usually no heavier than 12-pounders. Originally a French design – but quickly adopted by the other European powers – the frigate is used for pursuit, convoy protection, commerce raiding and reconnaissance work. The design’s excellent sailing characteristics and good handling, especially in inshore waters, make it a useful addition to any blockading fleet. The frigate’s ability to operate far away from a home port also makes it a useful cruiser, carrying the fight to the enemy in unexpected waters. 

Frigates can have the advantage over larger, two-deck ships in rough waters. A frigate captain rarely has to worry about his gun deck taking on water, and can therefore fight in conditions that leave bigger ships at a disadvantage. However, fifth rates are not powerful enough to face battleships. They have the speed and handling to stay out of trouble; they do not have the strength of construction to survive a pounding! Against sloops, brigs and merchantmen, however, they are deadly. This makes them excellent postings for officers hungry for prize money and glory. 

Frigates captains made splendid role models for fictional heroes: Thomas, Lord Cochrane earned a fortune in prize money, gained the nickname “le loup des mers” (sea-wolf) and was the inspiration for fictional heroes Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_6th_rate	"

The Royal Navy system of rating ships defines a “sixth rate” as a small frigate: a single-deck ship, square-rigged, with around 28 nine-pounder guns, and a crew of around 200 men. This is the smallest vessel in the system set out by Samuel Pepys (the very same fellow who is now famous for his sometimes rude diaries), and the smallest command of a post captain. This means that sixth rate captains are either old men, passed over for command, or young, ambitious officers looking to make their mark. It’s also worth pointing out that, even with “only” 28 nine-pounder cannons at his command, the captain of a sloop has more firepower than many generals ashore!

Historically, the sixth rates’ small size made them handy for scouting work and perfect where speed and good sailing qualities were required. They were a very good counter to privateers in smaller luggers, brigs and sloops; sixth rates can chase them down and have enough guns and men to win the subsequent engagement! They were also extremely useful in blockades, as they could sail in shallow waters and keep close watch on enemy ports."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_flying_shuttle	"

Manually-powered looms can only make pieces of cloth that are no wider than the easy reach of the weaver, simply because he has to throw the shuttle carrying the woof across the warp threads on the loom. A flying loom uses a clever arrangement of lines and pulleys to launch the “flying” shuttle with a tug on a cord, catch it at the other side of the loom, and return it with another tug of the cord. The width of the loom, and so the width of the cloth, can be increased as a result, and the quality of the cloth also improves, as the weaver is now free to use one hand to comb and compact the woven material.

The device was invented by Englishman John Kay (1704-80), and it brought him little but unhappiness. Weavers saw it as a threat to their livelihoods, and other inventors stole the idea and never paid him a penny for his work. The unfortunate man died penniless, having failed to sell his idea to the French (Good Lord, the French!) after his ill luck in Britain."	false

events_event_text_mercury_thermometer	"A new member of the Royal Society, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, has demonstrated a new kind of thermometer - capable of measuring a wider range of temperatures than previous designs.

After the early death of his parents from mushroom poisoning, Fahrenheit worked briefly as a merchant, trained as a glassblower and maintained a keen interest in scientific matters. He eventually settled in The Hague, where he now produces precision scientific instruments such as barometers and thermometers.

As mercury is less volatile than alcohol, it is thus able to measure higher temperatures, and has a high coefficient of expansion ideal for use in thermometers, Fahrenheit hit upon the idea of filling his thermometers with mercury. He then needed to devise a suitable scale to use with his invention for recording temperatures, modestly naming it after himself. Of course it’ll never catch on."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_sextant	"

The basic purpose is to measure the height of a star or other heavenly object above the horizon. If a measurement of the sun’s height at noon is taken, then the measured angle relates directly to the latitude of the observer using the sextant. Skilled navigators can also use the moon or any star listed in a naval almanac for the same purpose. If a navigator uses his sextant horizontally, he can measure the angle between any two prominent landmarks and so, by triangulation, accurately fix his own position on a chart. This is a huge advance on any method of dead reckoning, even if it does not help in establishing longitude.

A sextant is a delicate thing, and requires skilled repair if damaged.

Historically, the sextant was a development of earlier devices like the backstaff and the astrolabe. The sextant is so called because the measuring arc is exactly one-sixth of a circle. Earlier attempts at similar instruments were the octant (one-eighth) and quadrant (one-quarter); both used the same basic sighting method, but the arc was either too small to be practical or made the device unwieldy."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_governors_mansion_european_gov_republic	"

Republics maintain representative government structures at a local level, with each province eventually having its own assembly as it becomes rich or populous enough to justify it. Locally elected worthies enact local laws, appoint or form the judiciary, raise militias, and exercise all the other functions of government, sometimes with a degree of common sense.

Representative government is the basis of a republic, although the qualifications needed to be a voter are often restrictive. Representation of “the people” is not necessarily democratic: most republics prevent the unwashed masses from voting by having property, age, sex, class, or religious restrictions. Of these, property and social class qualifications are by far the most common – the logic being that only men of substance have a properly vested interest in their nation’s survival, and the wisdom to exercise their franchise correctly. Historically, even the Founding Fathers of America were very careful in establishing that only men with property could vote – universal suffrage was an alien and frightening idea!"	false

Education is not a right or even considered much of a privilege in many societies. The skills of reading (a little), hunting, and beating recalcitrant servants are the only worthwhile accomplishments of “proper gentlemen”. A smattering of religious education puts a veneer of civilization on top.

The emerging middle and mercantile classes value education a good deal more highly, and pay for it to be drummed into their children! A few schools, mostly the work of charities and religious bodies, exist to teach the children of the deserving poor, or give orphans some kind of start in life.

The British system of state education and “public schools” (which are actually non-state, private schools) owes its confusing terminology to this period. Public schools were open to the public – the public who could pay – while private schools took pupils as they saw fit. British mass “state education” would have to wait for another century. State education existed in some countries, but always ran the risk of creating an imbalance between learning and obedient loyalty if it was extended much beyond those with a real stake in society."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_barbary_xebec	"

These relatively small vessels have three masts carrying fore-and-aft lateen sails, making them handy sailors and speedy, even in light winds. The lateen sails also allow the ship to sail close-hauled to the wind, making pursuits easier. Even when becalmed, some xebecs can still be dangerous enemies to face, as they carry oars and can close with an enemy at a time of their own choosing.

Although not quite as well armed as a European frigate, xebecs carry a formidable arsenal of 12- or 18-pounder guns. This, combined with their excellent sailing characteristics, makes them particularly suitable for piracy, and the corsairs – the infamous Barbary Pirates – of the North African coast use them. They can also carry a good-sized crew of ruffians! 

Historically, the Barbary Pirates were a severe threat to European traders for centuries, partly because of excellent warships like the xebec (the name probably comes from an Arabic word “shabbak”, meaning a small warship). Eventually a few xebec-frigates were used by European Mediterranean naval powers, where the basic xebec hull shape was preserved but the distinctive lateen sails were replaced by square rigged sails. A few xebecs carried a hybrid rig with both square and lateen sails."	false

To this end, the horses of these regiments are all large beasts, and trained to bring out a nasty temperament: it is not just the rider who fights in some cases! They use their weight to push enemies back, while slashing to kill and maim.

Historically, many regiments of horse were raised under contract by a colonel, and were regarded as his personal property. A colonel could choose his own officers by selling commissions or by appointing his friends and cronies to the posts. He also had a free hand over drill, uniform and horses for “his” regiment, and it was not unknown for unscrupulous men to have a few “ghosts” in the regiment so that their pay could be claimed from the government and kept by the colonel. Given that the regiment was “his” property, it was also not unknown for a colonel to argue with his general if his men were ordered to carry out dangerous, unpleasant or low-status tasks. A colonel had his honour and profits to consider, after all."	false

Even though they are places of peace, not everyone who makes a pilgrimage to an ashram has peaceful intent.

Historically, the Ottoman Empire relied almost entirely upon its Muslim population for administrators at every level. Minority religions were granted legal protections and treated leniently, but it was almost unheard of for a professed Christian or Jew to reach a position of high authority. Although education was valued, the janissaries did have something of a military stranglehold on the administration of the Empire.

events_event_text_smallpox_jenner_vaccination	"Dr Edward Jenner has struck a mighty blow against one of mankind’s greatest enemies: the deadly disease known as Smallpox!

As a boy, Jenner was apprenticed to a doctor and noticed that farm workers who contracted cowpox never seemed to develop the human form of the disease. Many years later, having studied medicine and set up his own practice, Jenner resumed his study of the relationship between the two diseases.

Whereas inoculation has the disadvantage of requiring access to a smallpox victim, Jenner hopes to achieve similar results from the harvesting scabs from less-harmful cowpox and keeping a supply available to ""vaccinate"" people in times when the disease does not have a strong grip - thereby ensuring it cannot get one.

In order to test his ""vaccine"", Jenner recently took the opportunity to use a milkmaid with cowpox to inoculate the son of his gardener against smallpox. Taking an enormous risk, Jenner then attempted to infect the boy with deadly smallpox, but happily this proved to be impossible!

Having presented his results to the Royal Society, Jenner is now engaged in a series of tests on voluntary subjects in order to confirm his results."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_college_ottoman	"

Education is expensive and exclusive, but provides a good basis for a career in both private business and the state administration. Society does not expect the college to be a hotbed of radical ideas, but to produce able, polished men who can occupy the highest positions with confidence. If nothing else, the personal contacts made will be extremely useful to a graduate, even if his academic attainments are a little lacking.

There is also a distinctly Turkish flavour to the education on offer, as Ottoman culture and achievements are (rightly, in the view of both teaching staff and students) celebrated and studied. There is a socially and nationally cohesive view of the world that is the legacy of an education here. This is not quite the same as a purely Islamic education on offer elsewhere.

Historically, the Ottoman Empire was always in need of able administrators. This was one of the reasons why it came to rely on the disciplined and educated military corps of janissaries to act as imperial functionaries. This, in turn, caused problems as the janissaries became more interested in their own perquisites than in their duties as civilian officials."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_social_contract	"

Theorists hold that humans naturally reside in the “state of nature.” In this state men are free to do as they wish, without the constraints of the “greater good.” However, some will seek to improve themselves, by working the land to create property. To protect this property man must leave the state of nature and seek society and the laws it provides. This is when a social contract is required, to describe what is expected of a member of society.

The social contract put forth by French Enlightenment thinker Rousseau (1712-78) sought to dispel the disorder that comes from man’s rise from the state natural. It also addressed the key problem presented to man in a community: how can we live together and still keep our individual freedom? Rousseau suggested that in order for individuals to live in harmony they must give their will to the “general will.” By laying aside ego men can begin to live as a community"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_settlement_fortifications	"

Settlement defences are seldom allowed to be truly impregnable defences. Practical matters such as cost, or the need to house a growing population, often stop city fathers from investing fully in their own defences. Instead, their defences are good enough to deter a casual attack, and good enough to hold up an enemy’s advance. Interlocking fields of fire can sweep attackers off the glacis as the defenders reap a terrible toll. It takes a disciplined approach to reduce a settlement’s fortifications to the point where a breach is “practicable” and the town can be taken.

Historically, town garrisons were often offered the “honours of war” and allowed to march away with their weapons, but only if they gave up without a fight. The townsfolk were likely to be spared any indignity. Once, however, the attackers had launched an assault then the town, its inhabitants and the garrison were fair game for any amount of pillaging and looting. The assault was a dangerous business, and a lawless orgy afterwards was often the soldiers’ reward."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_lugger	"

Like many European ships, the ship’s rigging style gives the lugger its name. Lugsails are a development of the classic square-rig of larger vessels. The sails have yardarms, but the attachment of the yardarms to the mast is off-centre. As a result, the sails lie fore-and-aft, with the yards at a jaunty angle, rather than at right angles to the keel as in a square rigged vessel. This sail layout has much of the efficiency of a square rig when running before the wind, combined with the handiness of a fore-and-aft when changing course. In addition, sailing the ship only needs a small number of sailors, leaving more of the crew to do other work – or fight. 

In military and quasi-military use, a lugger carries only a small complement of light guns, but these are usually sufficient to overpower or overawe a merchantman’s crew. A lugger is unlikely to survive for long against a properly handled armed naval vessel. However, the lugger’s speed and good handling qualities make it ideal for coastal scouting and a little light piracy! 

Historically, the French “chasse-marée” is a type of lugger, originally a type of swift fishing boat. French privateers (pirates operating under a government licence) used these swift vessels to raid British commercial shipping."	false

Hunting is a way of life, and the methods and techniques used have been handed down for generations. The seasons play a huge role in the way hunting parties operate:. in autumn when the grasses are dry, fire is used in hunting. Once a herd of animals is located a large arc of fire is started while, the hunters pick the animals as they run from the flames.

events_event_text_last_jig_at_the_tyburn_tree	"Tyburn has been a place of execution in London since 1196, and the terrible Tyburn Tree - three eighteen-foot wooden legs supporting nine-foot crossbeams arranged in a triangular shape - was in place and use from 1571 to 1759. The design of the Tyburn Tree made it possible to execute many criminals at once, the record being twenty four hanged simultaneously in 1649.

Straddling the roadway at the junction of Edgware Road and Bayswater Road at the edge of Hyde Park, the gallows served as a grim reminder to any potential wrongdoers of the power of law in Britain, attracting large crowds whenever there was a hanging day. The tree was eventually removed in 1759, as it was blocking the highway; and a smaller mobile gallows has been used ever since.

Now Tyburn's time as a place of execution is past, as its last victim - highwayman John Austin - has been hanged. As the procession from Newgate has become more and more difficult to manage - with escape attempts, rescues, and sometimes even premature killings a common spectacle - the authorities have decreed that in future condemned prisoners will be hanged outside the prison walls instead."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_5th_rate_admiral	"

These handy frigates are used for pursuit, convoy protection, commerce raiding and reconnaissance work and, when operating as a detached squadron, as a flagship for the admiral in charge. Excellent sailing characteristics, especially in inshore waters, make it a useful addition to any blockading fleet, and perfect for aggressive admirals. Accommodations for the flag officer and his small staff may be a little on the snug side, as these are fighting vessels with little spare room for many creature comforts. This is a footling inconvenience when considered against the chance to carry the fight to the foe! An admiral’s flagship, normally a somewhat staid appointment, is an excellent appointment for men who are hungry for glory – when that flagship is a frigate.

Historically, the term “fifth rate” is a Royal Navy one, and applies to the largest single-deck frigates, mounting some 44 12-pounder guns. However, every navy that used European designs found a use for this class of vessel."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_barracks_european	"

They are a statement in brick and stone that the military are present to defend the state and keep order. Usually constructed around a drill square, they are a carefully segregated military world deliberately kept apart from the civilians beyond. The walls present a blank, defensible, and intimidating face to the outside world. It can be important to keep troops away from the assorted temptations of flesh and the bottle. Civilians also harbour unsuitable, unmilitary ideas of disobedience and disloyalty – there must be limits to what an army can permit its men to think!

Historically, in Europe the fashion for building barrack blocks seemed to mirror the fascination with the Classical World of Greece and Rome. Among its other achievements, the Roman army had standardised designs for military buildings; armies in the 18th Century began to be similarly standardised. Governments employed good architects too: Nicholas Hawksmoor, for example, built the garrison barracks at Berwick-upon-Tweed for the British government. He was almost the equal of Sir Christopher Wren in talent if not in lasting fame, and produced many fine churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire of London."	false

The guard are trained to fight in the same fashion as line infantry, standing in line to deliver volley fire from their smoothbore muskets. They are, however, considered to be elite, as they are chosen for their devotion to the national cause and for their personal courage. In a republic all men may be equal, but the guard are more equal than other soldiers!

In much the same way as a royal or household guard would do in a monarchy, this force also has a ceremonial role, giving protection to the head of state. Their presence at formal occasions adds gravitas to the business of the republic. A republican guard is different from a royal guard in one other respect: it can include political officers in its ranks, whose main job is to watch for signs of disloyalty.

Historically, the “palace guard” sometimes became the only unit a leader could rely on when politics got out of hand, most of the time. It was not unknown for the guard to take the role of “kingmakers”, even in a republic, and only give their protection to a presidential candidate of whom they approved."	false

Tribal structure relies on everyone knowing his place and recognising where power is vested. The tribal sub-chiefs need a supreme leader to bring them together, to be a voice for the people. The High Chief fulfils this role, acting as father to his tribe with, if he is wise, the guidance of the medicine men and older warriors.

Historically, tribal leaders were the key in determining tribal policies, especially towards the invading Europeans. King Philip’s War of 1675-6 seems to have been the result of Metacomet (or “King Philip” as the English settlers called him) realising that trading tribal lands for goods was the height of folly, despite what previous leaders had done."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_americas_long_rifle_men	"

The fur trade which thrives in the American frontier forests is a rich source of men who are reliant on their marksmanship for survival. With no ready access to the kind of manufactories found in Europe, this hardy and self-sufficient breed have learnt to fashion their own rifles. The guns themselves reflect the demands made by their environment. With an unusually long rifled barrel, they are far more accurate than any smooth-bore musket, an important factor when powder and shot are hard to come by and game must be stalked for many hours before a shot can be taken. This distinctive design is however slightly awkward to reload.

The skills of the hunter translate well to the battlefield, especially when employed against regular troops who often have no experience of such tactics and no answer to a foe who appears as if from nowhere and will not then stand still to be shot at. Adept at concealing themselves amongst trees, these men can stalk any prey, remaining hidden as they slowly move within range."	false

Made using the latest industrial production methods, Jameson’s whiskey is triple-distilled, as opposed to traditional scotch which is double-distilled. Other differences lie in the types of barley used by Jameson and that this barley is roasted over Kilkenny Anthracite coal fires, rather than the Scottish method which uses peat fuel.

Whatever the differences regarding the way it is produced, Jameson's lives up to the ancient Gaelic term for whiskey: ""uisce beatha"", or the ""water of life""!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_prussia_brandenburg_gate	"

Sited on one of the original city gates of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate stands at the end of the Unter den Linden, the original approach to the city palace of Frederick II, the King of Prussia. The monumental entrance was always intended to overawe and dwarf anyone going to the palace, making clear Prussian greatness before they had even begun their audience with the monarch.

The choice of a Classical style was quite deliberate, as it was intended to echo the achievements of Rome and Greece. The decoration of a Quadriga of Victory, or four-horse chariot, is also intended to evoke ancient connotations of triumph, specifically the quadriga from the Hippodrome of Constantinople. It was definitely a symbol of peace through strength, which is almost certainly one of the reasons that it was looted and taken to Paris by Napoleon in 1806 after his victory at Jena-Auerstedt. The quadriga was returned in 1814, when Napoleon went into exile on Elba, and given the Iron Cross symbol that it currently carries. Subsequently, the Brandenburg Gate managed to survive two World Wars and the Cold War in a relatively undamaged state."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_sp_ed_organ_gun	"

An organ gun has several barrels that are fired, almost simultaneously, when the gunner applies the match. In theory, each barrel could be loaded with a different kind of projectile, although given the different ranges of, say, shot and canister, this would be wasteful. Only a suicidal or slightly mad artilleryman would use explosive shells. There is a good chance that the first shell would have exploded in its barrel before the last is prepared.

There has always been a tendency to make artillery pieces with more than one barrel. The great Leonardo da Vinci was among many to design a ribauldequin, or volley gun. As so often with artillery, the Ottoman Turks were ahead of European gunmakers in their work. They also persisted with producing organ guns after other nations had abandoned them. They also experimented with cannons of differing calibres, where a central barrel would be surrounded by small bore tubes cast into the main cannon wall. The French also flirted with a design for a triple-barrelled cannon early in the 18th Century, but it was heavy and offered no real advantages over three ordinary guns of the same calibre."	false

Although a sword, no matter what its design, may appear outdated next to a musket, it has one great advantage: it never needs loading. A truly skilled swordsman will never want for employment, and he is an intimidating sight to many regular musket-armed soldiers.

Units of swordsmen are also easier to handle tactically on a battlefield. A general does not have to make fine judgements about when to hold or give fire: he need only send his men forward to do their killing work at the right time. Once committed, they will keep fighting until death or victory comes."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_cannon_foundry_european	"

The casting of early cannons is more of an art than a science, and few of the weapons produced are standardised pieces. This is the result of casting limitations, the quality of iron or bronze available, and the manufacturing process (cannon casting was an adaptation of bell making). Most 6-pounders would be around the right calibre, but no two were truly identical. It was enough that the cannon did not burst and kill its crew, and hurled a shot in the general direction of the enemy. 

Cannon foundries are also responsible for making the ball shot used by the weapons, but not the powder. No one but a raving lunatic would make gunpowder anywhere near a foundry, with the risk of stray sparks and consequent catastrophe! That said, making guns, like any casting work, is a dangerous business: if the sand moulds are even slightly damp then a steam explosion can occur. Anyone nearby is likely to be killed or maimed by hot metal and pieces of the mould. 

In 1716, an explosion at the English foundry in Moorfields killed and injured many people when metal was poured into a damp mould. Among those hurt were Colonel Armstrong, the Surveyor-General of Ordnance. The foundry itself was totally destroyed."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_threshing_machine	"

The harvesting of any cereal crop is only one part of the work. Threshing is the backbreaking process of separating the grain from the stalks: work that takes as long as the gathering-in of the crop itself. This horse-driven machine takes the grain, separates it from husk and stalk, and then collects it. The work of many men is done in seemingly no time at all, and with less wastage.

Historically, Scottish inventor Andrew Meikle’s (1719-1811) threshing machine was not an immediate success, but the design soon improved. Its inner workings can be deduced from its other name of “thrashing machine”!

It was not popular among the rural working classes, as many lost their jobs. The 1830 Swing Riots included machine breaking by the dispirited and desperate rural poor, mirroring the urban Luddite riots that targeted mills. “Captain Swing”, the mysterious leader and figurehead of the rioters, probably never existed as a single individual, making “him” impossible to trace and catch!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_military_billets_european	"

As a way of cheaply housing soldiers, billets seem ideal to many European governments: soldiers are assigned to houses in a local town and the householders are expected to look after them. There is no need to build anything, only the expense of compensating the locals! Other ranks are allocated to the hovels of the lower orders; officers are generally billeted with the local “professional” class such as clergy, doctors and lawyers. With luck, an officer can expect to have a comfortable, even luxurious, place to stay. 

The English term “billet” is the French word for “ticket”, this being the promissory note given to householders to pay for the soldiers’ food and drink during their stay, not the actual building itself. 

Historically, the billeting of troops in civilian houses was not without its problems. Dispersing men across a town was not a good way to maintain discipline, particularly as the subsistence allowance often went on drink – hardly surprising given that the places best able to cope with boisterous men were often public houses. Soldiers and drink rarely mix to good effect. Local grumbling and disloyalty could encourage men to desert when away from their officers."	false

The 33rd Foot are known as “The Pattern” for their stoic professionalism in battle; they are able to calmly pick targets and fire on them even while skirmishers’ shots whiz by their ears, artillery shells explode around them and cavalry charges bear down upon them. To guard against such devastating enemy charges they can move from line to square formation.

The 33rd Foot was originally raised in 1702 as the Earl of Huntingdon’s Regiment of Foot. It was not until 1751, when all regiments were numbered rather than taking their general’s name, that it became the 33rd Foot. They left England for America in May of 1776 and were part of the force that besieged Charlestown. They joined Howe’s New York campaign and took part in a number of key battles including Brandywine. Despite losses the 33rd Foot were able to break the American line, pursuing them for a full 2 miles. The regiment eventually became “The Duke of Wellington’s”, the only unit in the British Army named to honour a non-Royal."	false

events_event_text_mozart_dies	"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, surely the youngest of the great composers, has died at the comparatively tender age of thirty five.

Taken ill whilst premiering his latest work in Prague, his hands and feet had swelled in size, and by the time Mozart had reached his home he had begun vomiting copiously. Still able to continue with his work, Mozart managed to complete his ""Clarinet Concerto"", the ""Little Masonic Cantata"" and even furthered his ""Requiem"" somewhat before becoming overcome by the disease in November. Throughout that month his body continued to swell up - the swelling soon joined by pain and vomiting - to the stage where it was not possible for Mozart to move without assistance, and he essentially became bed-ridden from that point onwards.

Mozart passed away on 5th December with his wife and family around him. Although the cause of the illness is not definitely known, it is suspected that the composer had Rheumatoid Fever - he had previously suffered from Rheumatism - and had not been poisoned by a rival as Mozart himself suspected."	false
building_description_texts_long_description_royal_palace_european_gov_constitutional_monarchy	"

An assembly of the great and good passes laws in the monarch’s name for the good order of the state, and not all these laws will be necessarily those wanted by the monarch. A good deal of hard-headed bargaining between the sovereign, his ministers and the parliamentary assembly ensures that while no one is ever entirely happy, no one is ever entirely excluded from the exercise and benefits of power. The assembled representatives allow the monarch to collect taxes and, in return, the state protects the liberties of subjects. The monarch is as bound by laws as his subjects.

Despite the involvement of the people in government, there need be no broad franchise. Property requirements, social class and religious affiliation often limit the entitlement to a vote. However, that the monarchy bothers to consult its subjects even to a limited extent is a remarkable thing: the sovereign has ceded power to the people and stuck by this contract, recognising that mostly-willing subjects are better than unwilling slaves cowed into obedience."	false
battles_description_battle_of_cowpens	"With the loss of Charleston and defeat at Camden in 1780, organised Continental military activity in the Southern colonies collapsed. The British under Lord Cornwallis now greatly outnumbered the Americans.

However the Americans have not been completely defeated. Nathanael Greene has been appointed leader of the US forces in the South, and a victory by Patriot militia at the Battle of Kings Mountain has helped boost morale. Greene has given command of some of his men to Brigadier-General Daniel Morgan. His mixed force of Continental and militia troops now face Colonel Banastre Tarleton’s British Legion. Tarleton, nicknamed “Bloody Ban” for his reputed part in a massacre of Patriot forces, is a skilled leader of light forces. Morgan, however, has created a battle plan to defeat him. Rallying his forces at the cow pens, his force has been set up in multiple lines ready for the battle.

See if you can win the battle for the Americans as well as Morgan did.

Historically the battle was a brilliant tactical victory for Morgan, with his plan resulting in a classic double envelopment of the British. The British force was almost annihilated, and the victory here helped contribute to the eventual British surrender at Yorktown."	false

Livestock and crops are a valuable commodity, allowing the population to grow without relying on what food can be found by hunting and gathering. They provide a constant food source, more than the meat brought in by hunting parties.

Although the processes involved in keeping farms went against the grain of Native Americans’ religion, they did keep crops. They tended to favor corn, beans and squash, crops they referred to as 'the three sisters.'"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_dockyard_european	"

Dockyards also have extensive shore facilities, such as ropewalks, forges, furnaces and, possibly most important of all, seasoning sheds. Using “green” timber for shipbuilding results in vessels that can “work” (have a little flexibility), something that French shipbuilders regard as a good thing, even though it means that their ships leak in heavy seas. Seasoning wood for months or years is prudent, and most other navies follow this practice.

On more than one occasion in the century Royal Navy raiding parties made a point of destroying stocks of timber – in particular masts – stored in enemy dockyards. The loss of timber stocks not only set back shipbuilding by many years, but also ensured that battle damage was hard to make good too. Burning timber rather than stealing it must have gone against the natural inclinations of many RN officers and seamen, as their prize money for the goods was also going up in smoke!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_elite_light_infantry_green_jackets	"

Organised and equipped as light infantry with rifles, not smoothbore muskets, riflemen have every right to see themselves as an elite. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they fight without close supervision from their officers. Their uniforms set them apart in an age when soldiers dress like peacocks: they deliberately blend into the landscape so that they can stalk their prey.

Historically, the most famous riflemen, the British Greenjackets, carried infantry rifles designed by Ezekiel Baker. This muzzle-loading flintlock used a small ball from a tightly rifled barrel to give superb accuracy. There are accounts of riflemen holding targets for each other at hundreds of paces! It was a slow business to load the piece properly, as high-quality powder was carefully measured out and the bullet wrapped in a leather patch then tapped down the barrel to engage with the grooves. All of this could take a minute or more to do properly, but the resulting shot was deadly over astonishing ranges. Baker even carefully supplied a long “sword bayonet” so that the overall length of his rifle plus bayonet matched that of a line infantryman’s bayonet-tipped musket."	false

Instead he has lived as a ""feral child"", entirely outside of human society - walking on all fours and generally behaving in an animalistic fashion - and presumably learned to survive by purely by observing the animals of the forest.

Named Peter, the boy has been brought to England at the behest of the King, who has shown an interest in him.

An elder is expected to be able to walk between the two worlds of men and spirits. Being able to bring back knowledge from the other world sets such a man apart and gives him wisdom which may belie his years. Many elders have spent the seasons of their lives on spirit quests, and have learned much. 

All decisions, even the smallest must go to the Council of Elders before any action can be taken. From the small to the great, everything must be considered: from marriages requiring the approval of the council to the blessing of this year’s hunting."	false

battles_description_battle_of_leuthen	"Whilst Fredrick the Great claimed victory at Rossbach, the Austrians had retaken Silesia. In response, he marched on Breslau and was met by the Austrians at the village of Leuthen. The combined Austrian armies of Prince Charles of Lorraine and Leopold von Daun were more than twice the size of the Prussian force.

Fearing that Frederick would use strategy of flank attacks that had so often defeated them in the past, the Austrians stretched themselves across four miles of the countryside.

Will this strategy contain the Prussian army? Or will Frederick the Great, once again, carry the day?"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_12_lber_land_cannon	"

Despite the name, foot artillery batteries are towed by horses, not men. The artillerymen march alongside their pieces. All guns are smoothbore, and rated by the size or weight of solid projectile that they fire: a 12-pounder is so called because it hurls a cannonball weighing 12 pounds towards the enemy! It may not do so very accurately, as the casting of barrels and balls means that there is inevitably a gap (windage) between a shot and the barrel sides. This means that a cannonball rattles down the barrel when fired, leading to an inherent inaccuracy.  As technology advances, other types of ammunition can be fired.

Historically, there was limited standardisation between guns, even in the same battery. Parts from one gun would not always fit a sister piece. A gunner would know the quirks of his own weapon intimately. Cunningly, the French attempted to develop a system of interchangeable components for all their guns and field equipment. Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval (1715-1789), the inspector of artillery, tried but he wasn’t entirely successful. Even after he had finished there were still more than 20 different types of wheel in use!"	false

Salting relies on preserving the caught fish in dry salt in barrels or boxes. This is the method favoured by many fishermen along the North African coast. Pickling preserves the catch in brine (sea water with even more added salt). In both cases, the salt stops any fungus or other rot setting in, and may even improve the taste of the fish, although the fish will need to soak in fresh water before it can be cooked.

All of this preservative work is required because the fleet ranges far out to sea for days at a time, looking for big shoals of fish. The cargo can take weeks to reach port, and even longer to reach inland markets, and if salting was not used the catch would be both disgusting and lethal to anyone eating it!"	false

The education offered is, however, completely non-sectarian. It focuses on Indian classics – and this includes some religious works – literature, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, natural philosophy, and the other accomplishments of gentlemen, such as hunting and swordplay (for self-defence). The aim is to produce administrators, warriors and intellectuals who can run the vast holdings of the native princes, and have a grasp of the finer things in life. Education is valuable and even an end in itself, but a certain practicality must be considered.

In the previous century, the Kerala school of mathematicians and astronomers in southern India had made great strides in both fields, easily rivalling the work of European mathematicians of the age. Neither the Indians nor the Europeans had any idea that others were at work on the same problems. In this, the Indians were following a long and proud tradition of intellectual achievement, invention and learning on the sub-continent. Many ideas that diffused to Europe through Islamic scholars owe their origins to Indian thought. The fusion of Indian and Islamic knowledge under the Mughals continued this tradition, and was to survive – for a while at least – the coming of European traders and invaders."	false

For a mine owner to gain the maximum profit from his investment, as much usable material as possible must be extracted from the ore. This means that a large number of processes must be carried out on an industrial scale: the ore will need to be washed, sorted by hand to extract worthless spoil, crushed, and finally smelted and ingots cast. All of these tasks need a large number of workers, and women and children do the work while their men labour in the depths. Even away from the shafts, the work is dangerous and deaths and injuries are not uncommon. It is also unhealthy work too: dust is ever present, and the fumes from smelting works are often poisonous. 

A large mine workings poisons the land and water for miles around, and turns pleasant countryside into a wasteland of spoil heaps and toxic ponds. This does not matter, as long as profit continues."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_3rd_rate_admiral	"

Overall, the “74” (from the number of guns carried) or “third rate” is a very practical vessel. With a crew of around 700 men, it has enough firepower and resilience to survive most battles. It can deliver a horrendously effective broadside from its 32-pounders (on the lower deck), 18-pounders on the upper deck and 9-pounders in the upper works. It also has enough space to house an admiral and his busy staff in some comfort, even if the ship’s officers have to sacrifice their living space.

Historically, many admirals and commodores chose 74s to be their flag vessels. In the 18th Century “commodore” was not a formalised naval rank, but an appointment as a “temporary fleet commander”. Appointing a commodore allowed the navy to choose any talented or well-connected captain, no matter how junior, for command. Admiral was usually a rank that any captain, no matter how useless, could reach if he lived for long enough!"	false

These gardens are often part of palace grounds, but open to the more important members of society so that they can marvel at the opulent riches and good taste of their rulers. The plantings are restrained and carefully managed: these are not gardens that reflect the wildness of nature, but places that show man’s mastery over the natural world. Geometry is as important as horticulture in the layout of paths, fountains, watercourses and planting beds.

Historically, formal gardens were a feature of many palaces in the Middle East and India, where collections of rare and exotic blooms could be displayed. Formal water gardens of enormous size were laid out, where rulers and their courtiers could take their ease and enjoy the cooler air in the shade of carefully tended trees. In particular, the extravagant use of water in a desert was the mark of limitless wealth."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_measuring_tools	"

Until there are reliable instruments, standard units of measurement can only exist within a single workshop or scientist’s laboratory. How can a scientist describe the distances or sizes of his experiments and be sure that anyone else is working to the same dimensions? Craftsmen must make everything, from a clock cogwheel to a musket mainspring to a spinning machine, by trial and error, relying on modifying pieces until they fit well enough to work, but not necessarily accurately. An accurate measurement method, which is used in different locations, means that consistency and repeatability can triumph!

Historically, Jesse Ramsden’s dividing engine and screw cutting lathe allowed the repeatable creation of graduations on measuring tools. Ramsden’s early work in Britain had been on the thorny problem of longitude, and a reward of £300 (a small fortune at the time) enabled him to expand his business and create the tools that lead to accurate sextants. By 1785 his expertise was being used to make a theodolite for the Royal Engineers’ Ordnance Survey, allowing the eventual mapping of the whole of the United Kingdom."	false

events_event_text_very_unpopular_book	"Chamberlain to the Queen Claude Adrien Helvetius, has caused a storm of argument by publishing a new philosophical work - ""De L’esprit"".

Taking an empirical viewpoint, he states that ""men are born ignorant, not stupid"" and argues that ""they are made stupid by education"" - that a new mind is a clean slate that learns from its senses and from the association of ideas. Therefore, good behaviour is entirely dependant on social environment and early association of pleasure and pain. Helvetius also argues that social welfare is best defined as the ""greatest happiness of the greatest number"", and that having been trained to do good, the educated should be in a position to make life easier for those uneducated.

Focusing on the implication that early association of pleasure and pain in itself involves an immoral act, both members of the church and many high-profile learned individuals have publicly attacked the book - leading even to a symbolic burning of the work by the hangman! Helvetius himself has already had to make three separate retractions of his ideas in order to calm the situation! Once again the readily available Encyclopédie, long known to be the source of all radical ideas, has been criticised also.

In private, empiricists wonder if the implication that the educated and wealthy have a social obligation to improve the lot of the poor, and that allowing the common man easy access to ideas (for example through a book such as the Encyclopédie) is the true source of the furore, as that would necessitate great upheaval in the current social system!"	false

events_event_text_isle_of_man	"For some considerable time following the death of Lord Derby, the British government has been manouvering towards revestment of the Isle of Man as a British possession.

The new Baroness Strange and Duchess of Atholl has decided to sell her family's interest in the Isle of Man to the government, ending almost eight hundred years of feudal rule.

The Lord of Mann will now automatically be the British head of state, and Britain has gained the power to levy and collect taxes on the island. This effectively starves the Manx government - the Tynwald - of money and power. No doubt this is not the end of the matter."	false

Other than domestic service or labouring in the fields, there are very few ways that a woman can earn an independent living. Selling herself and her skills as a sexual partner are an obvious choice to many, and brothels provide a relatively safe place to work – certainly safer than the city streets. Male prostitution is not unknown, and some brothels cater for an entirely different clientele.

Historically, India had a tradition of raising lovemaking to a fine art. A significant portion of the Sanskrit “Kama Sutra” deals explicitly with sex, and another considers the acquisition and use of courtesans as lovers. This was an additional reason for the fascination of European traders and soldiers in India, far from home as they were, with the local women. A flourishing community of expatriates who were married to, or living with, native Indian women existed in the 18th Century. The somewhat bigoted ideas of “Victorian” morality and “muscular Christianity” among later cohorts of colonial administrators put paid to this and, ironically, brothels enjoyed a resurgent trade."	false

These iron tubes filled with gunpowder propellant are fired in large volleys; the noise alone could be somewhat unnerving. Each rocket is laid in an angled launcher, and it is the job of the artilleryman to correctly judge the angle of launch to drop the rockets in the middle of the enemy. He also needs to take into account wind, as the long tails of the rockets can mean they are blown off course. The least dangerous rockets are tipped with a large spear point, but explosive heads are also fitted.

Historically, it was the Indian war rockets used by Tippu Sultan of Mysore that introduced Europeans to the concept. The experience was not a pleasant one. The British copied these weapons as the Congreve rocket system, and used them aboard ships as well as on land. A rocket troop was present at the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, although accounts of their effectiveness vary. Congreve’s system even included illumination rounds to light up the battlefield!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_eua_tarleton_dragoons	"

Named for Banastre Tarleton, also known as “The Bloody Ban”, these troops are ideal for countering enemies such as skirmishers and artillery. Tarleton’s dragoons have fast horses and can quickly reach enemies out of range of friendly line units. Upon reaching their target, they can unleash a cavalry charge or engage in melee. Dismounted, they can use their carbines to fire upon the enemy, although they are relatively vulnerable in close-combat.

Banastre Tarleton sailed to America as a volunteer in 1775, quickly earning the rank of major for his bravery in the New York campaign. By the time Tarleton retired he had worked his way up through the ranks to general, and was even invested as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, a significant honour, for his efforts. Officially the 17th Light Dragoons, Tarleton’s troopers were the mounted element of the British Legion. At the time, the Legion was a mixed force of cavalry and infantry and was sometimes referred to as Tarleton’s Legion."	false

events_event_text_new_atomic_theory	"A new theory published by the brilliant Dalmatian scientist Roger Joseph Boscovich in his ""Theoria philosophiae naturalis redacta ad unicam legem virium in nalura existentium"" - ""Theory of natural philosophy derived to the single law of forces, which exist in nature"" - has caused great excitement within the scientific community.

This new work is an attempt by the Jesuit-educated Boscovich to better explain the structure of the universe. Boscovich’s ""atomic"" theory suggests that objects are not composed of solid, continuous matter but of prodigious numbers of point-like structures or ""atoms"", which are indivisible as the smallest particles in existence. He further suggests that these atoms are centres of force, and that this force varies in proportion to their distance from each other.

The view this theory provides of our three dimensional world in microcosm is guaranteed to open up new vistas in human understanding, and can only serve to shed light on the ""bigger picture""!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_deep_gem_shaft_european	"

Given that miners are paid only for the gemstones they find and not for any other work, the shaft sunk into the ground is often extremely crude. Shoring up and pumping out the shaft may seem like sensible activities, but both of these things go unpaid and therefore undone. The mine owners do not care about casualties: men who die need no wages, merely hold up production and stop others earning. 

The shafts often have to go deep indeed, as gemstones are deposited in very small areas. This does not matter. All that matters is finding riches. Few miners worry that side tunnels are little more than death traps, given the chances of discovering the perfect stone!"	false
building_description_texts_long_description_iron_workshops_european	"

Smiths make everything that the world of work uses, from ploughshares, horseshoes and sickles to knives, nails, and wagon tyres. They even make the machinery to make more machines, as they make tools for themselves and other crafts not to mention the working parts of many workshops. The number of people with the surname “Smith” (or its equivalent) shows the historical importance of ironworking!

The job is, however, dirty and dangerous. Fire is an ever-present danger, and working with red hot metal has risks all of its own. It breeds tough, hardy, independent men with an unsentimental eye for profit. 

Making iron requires a great deal of charcoal as fuel. This means that the secondary industry of charcoal burning uses large tracts of woodland to make charcoal, and is one of the main limitations on iron production. It is almost impossible to produce enough charcoal, year after year, to keep the furnaces burning because managed woodlands don’t grow fast enough."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_2nd_rate_british	"

This three-deck warship is a compromise design between the firepower of a first rate ship and the sea-keeping qualities of a third-rate 74. Like many compromises, the result is something that pleases few, but the extra weight of the broadside does compensate for poor sailing qualities. The design does have one unexpected benefit: enemy captains are often quick to identify second rates as much larger ships and, as a result, flee from a “much superior” enemy! 

The lower gun deck houses 32-pounders, and this explains the “tumblehome” shape of all ships of the period: the bulge at water level and just above in the hull allowed more room on the lower decks for the recoil of large cannons; the lighter guns on the higher decks did not recoil as much.

Historically, only the British Royal Navy commissioned many ships of this rating; other nations simply built first rates instead. This might be due to the Royal Navy needing to keep large ships on foreign stations as flagships, an assignment that would have been wasteful and expensive for a first rate."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_diamond_formation	"

A diamond formation, as the name suggests, is a way of employing all the men of a cavalry unit to best effect. Rather than being arranged as a simple wedge, point towards the enemy, the unit tapers off from its broadest point. Even though the riders may be knee-to-knee to maximise the shock of impact should a charge connect with a target, a diamond-formed unit can change direction quickly. This is not true with the earlier cavalry wedge, the members of which find any kind of wheeling turn difficult to execute.

Historically, the Swedes were among the leaders in European cavalry tactics at the start of the 18th Century; King Charles XII was all in favour of closely packed, large cavalry formations as he believed that these could break the enemy by fear alone. There was debate among military men in other nations too: in Britain the Duke of Marlborough favoured his cavalry charging home with cold steel, rather than relying on fear or bullets to do their terrible work."	false

As France no longer has a presence on the continent, you will have to maintain friendly relations with the Spanish and the Plains Nations for trade to flourish between you. This should enable you to concentrate your military efforts against the Iroquois, and to push Great Britain out of the traditional Huron homelands they currently occupy. It is important that you do not use European fighting styles when facing these enemies – their drill and firepower will always be superior, so you must use irregular tactics and make good use of your ability to hide in plain sight if victory is to be attained.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_kilns_european	"

With a move to large kilns, unskilled work supplements the craft skills of a potter. Each individual worker masters one skill, such as sticking on handles, using a plate mould, or glazing pottery. This type of working is an early form of the division of labour, allowing faster production with a relatively unskilled (and therefore cheaper) workforce. Pottery at an industrial kiln is still a batch-production process, although the kilns are so large that they can take a week to fill with wares before firing, and at least as long to cool down again afterwards. Factory owners are under no obligation to let the kilns cool before expecting workers to enter and empty them.

Historically, as large-scale production of pottery got underway in the English Midlands by Josiah Wedgewood and others, better transport links followed: there was little point in making fine china if it was going to be smashed to pieces in a cart! Wedgewood’s need to reach markets partly fed into a wave of canal construction, which in turn allowed exploitation of distant resources, thereby creating a virtuous circle of prosperity."	false

Fighting in formal order with tight control and disciplined fire is a new idea for Turkish forces; the traditional method has usually involved heavily armed and very brave men hurling themselves pell-mell at the enemy. The nizam-I cedit fight just as bravely, but with much more organisation. This “new model” army is such a break with the past that it has even adopted Western-style military dress for the most part.

Historically, the Nizam-I Cedit reforms were made vital by the repeatedly poor performance of the Ottoman armies against the Russians. The Empire’s inability to defend itself against a growing Slavic threat, and European predatory moves, was the reason why Turkey became the “sick man of Europe”. The French Revolutionary Republic (anxious for any allies at the time) provided much of the starting expertise that the Ottomans required for retraining their army in modern tactics and methods. The process was not without problems, though. The janissaries resented their loss of privileges and position and eventually the corps had to be disbanded."	false

The Protestant faith has always encouraged learning and the associated hard work of study among its faithful. Indeed, intellectual effort and its rewards are seen as being as worthy as physical labour, something that reflects the Protestant work ethic. It has also encouraged a degree of curiosity and free thinking about Creation, although within sensible limits. Curiosity is one thing, non-conformism and radicalism something else entirely, and hardly welcome in society at large!

Historically, the Protestant work ethic maintained that hard work and subsequent worldly success were indications of personal salvation. This, supposedly, encouraged the faithful to work all the harder. It is, however, a simplistic analysis to see that this lead directly to the intellectual, industrial and financial successes of Protestant nations in the 18th Century. The end of Catholic strictures against usury (money lending) almost certainly helped fuel mercantile and industrial progress."	false

Originally formed as the Church’s “shock troops” of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuits have long used education as a weapon in their struggle against Protestant heresy. Their colleges give Catholic students an excellent grounding in many disciplines, as well as making sure that their faith is certain and sure. A few pupils receive scholarships or charity, but the majority of them are the children of the social elites in Catholic nations. Jesuit Colleges have an essentially conservative bent, and exist to confirm the existing political and social order (and the Church’s over-arching authority) in the minds of the students, not make them question the world.

The Society of Jesus has a long tradition of intellectual excellence, a legacy of its duty to debate with Protestant reformers of the Church. Many of the Vatican’s best scientists and thinkers have been found among its ranks. The Jesuits also have a long tradition of educating the laity, and still provide a secular and religious education that is the equal of any other in the world."	false

Atakapa Warriors have a fearsome reputation and an ability to read a landscape intimately. This allows them to move swiftly and silently without the possibility of detection. The combination of field craft and an element of surprise make these warriors ideal for ambush and sudden skirmishes. The Atakapas’ weapons of choice are tomahawks, small axes that lend themselves perfectly to quiet attacks, either when thrown or in hand-to-hand combat.

The Atakapa originated from present day Louisiana and had a reputation among their neighbours for cannibalism. Literally translated, the name Atakapa means ‘man-eaters’, and was given to them by the Chocktaws. The Atakapa actually referred to themselves as the Ishaks or ‘people’. There is, of course, always the chance that the name Atakapa might have been a misunderstanding between the Chocktaws and the French explorers who first recorded the name. Cannibalism was extremely rare amongst Native American tribes, and the few recorded descriptions concern the ritualised eating of vanquished foes."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_military_academy_european	"

In most countries, military command is limited to those in the ruling classes. There is a quite sensible belief that only those with a stake in the survival of society will defend it properly. However, there are counter-arguments to the effect that military matters are complicated, and “gentleman amateurs”, no matter how well connected, are not good enough. Military academies, therefore, teach the theory and practice of the military sciences. The graduates, however, are sometimes regarded as common tradesmen because of their knowledge.

The French were the pre-eminent military power of Western Europe, and lead the way in military teaching with the creation of a “École Militaire” in 1751 to educate promising cadets from poorer backgrounds. It was later re-organised and re-named as the “École des Cadets-gentilshommes” or “School of Young Gentlemen” which subverted the original intent, although Napoleon Bonaparte was a graduate of the new school. By contrast, the United Kingdom’s military schools mostly provided an education for the orphans of serving officers, with no more than the hope that the pupils would go into the army. The Ottoman military system included the Janissaries, a class of warrior-administrators, selected and indoctrinated as children, who effectively ran the Ottoman Empire."	false

It is located on top of an imposing mountain, making any attempt to take it difficult indeed. Even a long siege would be a difficult proposition, as the fort is well supplied with water. The fort itself controls the surrounding countryside completely: no foe can move in southern Maharashtra without being observed.

The fort was taken by Shrimant Shahu Sambhaji Raje Bhonsle Chhatrapati Maharaj (1682-1749), the fourth ruler of the Maratha Empire. Shahu Chhatrapati was a survivor, of both Mughal captivity and a Maratha civil war. He was freed at the end of the War of 27 years (1681-1707) and managed to bring stability and careful expansion to the Marathas. Given that he had spent most of his childhood as an honoured prisoner of the Mughals, his efforts are creditable indeed."	false

The factory normally has a series of coal-fired kilns, so production can be more or less continuous. One kiln is filled with unfired wares while another is firing, a third is cooling, a fourth being carefully unpacked and so on. Coal is the fuel because charcoal is simply not available in the necessary quantities.

The pottery produced is both relatively cheap and of a consistently high quality: mass-produced standard designs add a touch of refinement to the life of the working classes, allowing them to own almost the same goods as their social betters. Relatively unskilled (and cheap) labourers produce these standard designs, as the production process has no need of individual creativity.

Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was the most famous of the “industrial potters”, producing high quality goods at an affordable cost for the burgeoning middle classes. His ceramic designs – Queen’s Ware (1762), Black Basalt (1768) and Jasper (1774) – were famous for their style and beauty, and influence styles still in production today."	false

As a result, the puddling furnace makes a very good quality end product. It does not, however, turn raw ore into refined metal: it needs refined iron of reasonable quality to produce the best results. The metal is placed in the heart of the furnace along with oxidizing agents and melted by blowing flames from the fire onto it; the puddle formed in the open hearth is manually stirred by the operators – a risky job for anyone! The iron produced can be worked further into wrought iron, a strong, malleable material with many uses.

Historically, English ironmaster Henry Cort (1740-1800) developed the process, partly in response to the poor quality of iron he dealt with in his job working for the Royal Naval Dockyards. Unfortunately, he was not much of a businessman and he did not gain great wealth from his work; he died a ruined man."	false

The third rate, or “74” (from the number of guns aboard), is a supremely practical weapon of war. With a crew of around 700 men, it is a “wooden world” in itself and a statement of national power. A two-deck design, it is strong enough to mount very heavy cannons on its lower gun deck, often 32-pounders. With 18-pounders on the upper gun deck and then 9-pounders in the upper works, it has a devastating broadside. The design and construction means a 74 can withstand horrendous damage in battle.

Historically, the French invented the concept of the 74-gun ship in the mid-18th century. The design was so good that other navies lost no time in copying it or in capturing French ships. French vessels, while well designed, were often made from green timber that “worked” in heavy seas and therefore leaked. Dutch examples had a shallower, broader draft to suit their harbours and shore waters. The few American 74s were extremely strong and well made. British 74s were well constructed too, although there was a regrettable tendency to save money by recycling timbers - complete with timber rot - from older vessels!

Amazingly, HMS Implacable, the last of the third rates, was scuttled in 1949! Built in 1800 by the French, and captured at Trafalgar in 1805, she stayed in service until 1842. Eventually, she ended her days as a coal hulk."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_commercial_basin_european	"

A commercial basin opens up new opportunities for trade, as agents now put together cargoes and charter vessels for merchants who would otherwise be unable to trade. Money, rather than sea experience, becomes the driving force for success, and trade does not even need to go through the basin to make money for the men of property!

The infamous triangle of trade between Bristol and Liverpool in England, Africa and the Caribbean sugar islands is possibly one of the most profitable trades ever invented. Manufactured goods, guns, cloth and trinkets went to Africa, where they were traded to the local warlords. Slaves, carried in the most horrendous conditions imaginable, made up the cargo for the middle run, across the Atlantic. In the Caribbean, the survivors were sold, and the ships loaded with sugar and rum for the run back to Britain. There was a handsome profit on each leg, and the ships were never idle. Even better, the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool never needed to see the suffering their commerce caused, always assuming that they cared."	false

These imposing predators, easily more than twice the weight of two large men, made the sparse mountain woodlands their home, preying on wild sheep and deer as well as the livestock of local Arab herders. As such, they came into conflict with the human population, and, coupled with the destruction of the lions’ natural habitat - and that of their prey by the gradually increasing cultivation of the land - put yet further pressure on the lion population.

It is not known whether the last examples were wiped out by hunters, starvation or disease - but the actions of mankind have certainly played a great part in the lions’ extinction."	false

Walls and fortifications may keep out enemies and their prying eyes, but are little use against the forces of nature. Channelling the spirit force of the wind to move through the world and see everything is a powerful thing. No word or deed can escape the vision granted. The mind’s eye can see all information about an enemy.

The Native American belief in the spirit world was more than religious: it was central to their continued existence as a people. The spirits existed in everything and, therefore, everything was connected and had a purpose and place in the world. From the mightiest oak to the smallest insect, from the flow of the river to the swirl of the storm, all had spirits. It was believed that people should exist in harmony with the spirits of nature rather than see them as something to be tamed and controlled."	false

Self-defence was part of life in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. A man expected to look after his own family and property as the local parish constables were not necessarily a reliable police force. In some parishes the constables were either old men, or non-existent. Men were also expected to join the local fencibles or trained bands, a militia for the defence of the kingdom in times of trouble. Skill-at-arms was therefore not unknown in the general population, and these skills were taken to the New World by the colonists. In times of tension with the native tribes, the fact that the colonists could, if needs must, protect themselves, was useful."	false

It is important that you do not use the same fighting styles when engaging European enemies on the battlefield – their drill and firepower will always be superior, but Pueblo warriors are skilled in irregular tactics and are finally a match for the Spanish in terms of horsemanship. Removing them from American soil will bring you into contact both with other native nations and the new nation of the United States, who will try to expand their territory westwards.	false

For all its smoke and noise, handling the smoothbore, muzzle-loading musket can be taught to all but the most stupid of men. Once the basic skills of loading have been mastered, it is simply a matter of pointing the loud end at the enemy and pulling the trigger. It is in God’s hands as to what happens next!

Even the most inexperienced or cack-handed of peasants can be useful with a musket in his hands. The noise of a volley is often enough to frighten, and any casualties in the enemy ranks are a bonus.

Historically, such units of irregular musket men would arrive at a battlefield with all kinds of weapons, from ancient matchlocks handed down from father to son, to modern government-issue weapons looted from the enemy dead. This lack of standardisation did not matter much, as it was the ability to fire at all that made the unit a useful force."	false

Up until now, lathes have worked by the operator holding the cutting tool against the spinning material in order to work it. This is an acquired skill and produces individual pieces, with no two exactly alike.

Maudsley, an employee of the celebrated hydraulic engineer Joseph Bramah, has produced a sliding tool holder fixed to the lathe itself which produces identical pieces time after time with only a modicum of operator ability.

Whilst there may be misgivings about this diminution in the importance of the operator’s skill, in reality the precision lathe requires a different, equally learnable skill to operate it well, and there are many more advantages to its use."	false

Fear the sound of Ojibwa Warriors travelling to war! Songs are sung, dances danced, and tales of glory told by the light of campfires. As they near a battle the Ojibwa make their final preparations for war: strong medicine is prepared and war paint applied. These are not men to quail in the face of an enemy.

In May 1830 the Indian Removal Act was passed by the US Congress. This allowed the United States government to move tribes from east of the Mississippi to the west. Though the process was supposedly voluntary, the system was used “creatively”. In 1850, the Ojibwa were forced to move when their annual payments and supplies were sent east, away from their spiritual home. Only a small percentage of the payment and supplies arrived, and as a result over three hundred Ojibwa died from disease and starvation. Public outcry eventually led to the Act’s repeal and the establishment of Native Reservations."	false

The committee is in charge of the design, development, casting and storage of artillery pieces for all the armed forces. The members are also in charge of powder production for the army and navy too, all too often with the bureaucratic muddle and rivalry that this can cause. The Ordnance is an important national asset because artillery is very expensive and yet a measure of national power.

Historically, great guns and siege weapons always required specialists to operate them, men quite separate from common soldiery. In charge was a Master of Ordnance, a man of some importance in medieval royal households. His duties of looking after the king’s artillery train eventually required a large staff of gunners, founders, powder makers, mathematicians, surveyors and even wagon drivers. In time, all of these men came under the control of the Board or Council of Ordnance, depending on the state involved, and they extended their responsibilities to take in the management of fortresses and, in some cases, the manufacture of all weapons for the army and navy."	false

This loyalist regiment is made up of line infantrymen who fire mass volleys into the main body of an enemy to break them. Once their ammunition is spent or the enemy is sufficiently weakened, they can fix bayonets and deliver a decisive charge. Because these men fight in close formation, they are vulnerable to long-range attacks by artillery and skirmishers, but they can counter cavalry charges by moving to a square formation.

The King’s Royal Regiment of New York was a misleading name for a regiment that was never actually stationed in New York. In fact, the men spent a great deal of their time in Montreal. The unit was originally comprised of colonists fleeing “patriot”, or rebel, persecution and in time they proved to be a very effective raiding party. This may have been thanks to the Native American warriors who often accompanied them in action. These warriors were led by their own chiefs, and the number attached to the regiment would vary in size depending on the campaign."	false

Glass is expensive, and it is better to ship casks to market and then have the consignment bottled by wine merchants to suit local tastes. The casks can then be broken down for easy shipment back for refilling. The maturing process in the casks is a happy accident that improves the flavour of the wine!

The 18th Century was a period when food adulteration was common – whitening flour with chalk, for example – and wine was no exception. Watering was the least offensive and probably safest practice, as the alcohol would kill infectious parasites and germs in the water. Also common was the practice of sweetening wine by adding various chemicals, including lead. Lead was known to be poisonous, but without legislation to protect customers, there was nothing that could be done to stop vintners adding whatever they wanted to wine."	false

The design itself is intimidating and unfriendly, precisely as a reminder of the truth of power in a state. The walls are high and largely windowless to the outside so that troops in a state barracks can be kept apart from the civilian population beyond the gates (that this makes the barracks defensible if need be is a bonus). If the soldiers are needed for policing duties, it is better that they have not developed too many local attachments and sympathies. The barracks provide all the facilities that should be needed for a proper military life, although this ignores the reality of soldiers’ needs for recreation and relaxation!

Caste and religious issues also entered into the construction of barracks in the Indian subcontinent. These issues mattered when housing troops, as did age-old regional and tribal rivalries; high-caste, hereditary (and therefore likely to be proficient) warriors would not react well if they were expected to break caste in their barracks. Religious restrictions could also play havoc with well-laid plans to house men and military animals."	false

Highland clans are the last tribal society in Western Europe. Men fight for their chieftains because they are expected to defend their clans’ honour and lands. They fight for these in the same way that they have done for centuries: with the broadsword and buckler, pistol, and Lochaber axe. There is little that regular line troops find as disturbing as the sight of a clan bearing down on them, screaming their hate and defiance. Highland Scots are brave, hard men.

Historically, the clans were destroyed as a military force at Culloden in 1746, by both British regulars and other, loyalist clansmen. The romance of the clans died on the field, along with a great many men who hurled themselves into a storm of lead and cannonballs armed with nothing more than swords. The clansmen were then repeatedly betrayed and used by their own chiefs, and then eventually driven off the land when sheep became more profitable. Highlanders were forced to scatter across the world, taking their fighting traditions with them."	false

The foundry furnace improves the quantity and quality of metal; guns can be created and adequate barrels can be made. The Warrior Society units that are furnished with such guns enter battle with confidence in, and knowledge of, in their weapons. This greatly enhances their utility on the battlefield.

Foundries and ironworks were established in America as early as 1619. The earliest example discovered so far was the Falling Creek iron works, established by the Spanish. It included the first blast furnace in America, and a water wheel that was powered by the nearby James River falls. The ironworks met its end in the summer of 1622 when the Powhaten tribe, led by Opchanacanough, organised a series of raids on the James River area. Falling Creek was burnt to the ground."	false

events_event_text_company_of_quenching_fire	"A devastating fire in Edinburgh has led to the introduction of a number of radical new measures in order to reduce the expenditure of insurance companies. As such they have been instrumental in the formation of the ""Company of Quenching Fire"", a force of men specifically tasked to both prevent and fight fires within the city.

In an act of Parliament entitled ""Quenching of Fires and Rules to be Observed by the Inhabitants Thereanent"", provision has been made for the municipal appointment of twelve firemasters. In turn each of these men has been tasked with the recruitment of a number of men to work on an auxiliary basis. However, with little money being made available for equipment or training, it would seem that the personal bravery of these recruits - and a certain amount of luck - will play a vital role until a body of experience can be built up.

Whatever their limitations, the Company is the first example of an organised municipal firefighting force within Britain, and it is hoped that the idea will soon be taken up far and wide!"	false

events_event_text_the_necklace_affair	"Rumours are sweeping the French court in the wake of scandalous revelations! A priceless diamond necklace, intended as a gift for the old King's favourite courtesan prior to his death; has been stolen in an affair which casts all those involved in an unflattering light.

It would seem that a relatively minor noblewoman, the Comtesse de Lamotte, tricked Cardinal Rohan into parting with funds belonging to the Queen, and persuaded the jewellers Boehmer and Bassenge to part with the necklace in the belief that it was intended for the Queen, whose payment would follow.

The Comtesse subsequently fled with the necklace and is believed to have broken it up for sale before she was arrested along with Rohan and others, after the makers asked the Queen for payment. At their subsequent trial, all were acquitted, barring the Comtesse - who was sentenced to be whipped, branded and locked up in prostitute's gaol. In the end she was spared the physical punishments but was ruined in French society, eventually fleeing to England.

However, questions continue to be asked about the Queen’s level of involvement in the case, as she was a known political enemy of Cardinal Rohan, and was visibly dismayed at his acquittal. Could it be that she played along with the fraud in order to ruin Rohan?

Regardless of the truth, such an unsavoury case can only serve to underline the cavernous gulf between the lives of ordinary French people and those of their rulers."	false

Shipping goods to a home market is only one way of making money from trade. There is more to be earned from shipping valuable goods to new markets in other countries. The ability to warehouse an incoming cargo and only release it when the price is right also increases profits.

Most maritime nations – Britain and Holland in particular – had rules that enforced a native nationals-only rule for carrying goods into their ports. Anything, for example, that arrived in the Port of London should have come in a “British bottom”. This kind of protectionism in trade also applied to colonies and indirectly caused at least one war, the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739-48), between Spain and Britain. The Spanish were alleged to have chopped off the ear when Jenkins was caught trading in Spanish territory; the British had previously agreed a treaty not to do this. The war became part of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-48) but, incidentally, marks the first public occasion that “God Save the King” was used as the British national anthem, to celebrate the capture of Puerto Bello in Panama by Admiral Vernon."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_airguns	"

There are two ways of powering an air gun: a pneumatic, pumped reservoir of air, or a spring-powered piston. The reservoir, which uses the muscles of the user to reach pressure, is by far the more reliable and practical mechanism. A piston requires very fine tolerances, making it too expensive and unreliable to manufacture. Given that any air gun is an expensive to make, it also makes sense to give them rifled barrels.

The Austrians were the only nation to employ airguns and with only partial success. The “Windbüchse” (wind rifle) was made by Girandoni (1744-1799), a gunsmith from the Tyrol. The weapon was accurate, quiet and quick firing, but too delicate for everyday use. It used a pneumatic system, fired a carbine-sized bullet, and had a 20-round integral magazine. An experienced user could fire off all 20 rounds in less than half a minute; a skilled rifleman would fire one round from a flintlock in that time. Cleverly, the reservoir was built into the stock, and could be removed independently from the magazine for recharging."	false

The earth is mother to all and no man can claim ownership. The tribes have lived by this rule for generations, and it serves them well. Although they control the land they occupy they do not own it. By respecting and living in harmony with the earth a tribe can obtain the maximum benefit, so improving the life of the people.

Forced migration out of traditional homelands claimed many lives: the Cherokee called this ‘the Trail of Tears’ with good reason. Some 17,000 Cherokee were forcibly transported across the Mississippi by soldiers under the command of General Winfield Scott in 1838. It is estimated that around 4000 of them died in the process, mostly from disease and starvation in the transit camps."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_shipyard_european	"

The services of a smithy within the yard are also very useful, as most ships use a surprising amount of bespoke ironwork in their construction, not to mention hundreds of nails! A shipyard can produce smaller vessels and carry out repairs and maintenance too. Careening is a regular chore for wooden vessels: hulls become fouled with weeds and barnacles that cause drag and slow the vessel. A shipyard has all the gear necessary to empty a ship, then haul it onto a beach or slipway so that it can be scraped clean and washed by the tides.

Historically, shipyards needed a good source of timber close by, or were on the estuaries of navigable rivers (so that wood could be shipped from further inland to the yard). Buckler’s Hard on the Beaulieu River in the New Forest in southern England is a typical shipyard in where it was constructed. However, it is larger than many, and had an extensive staff of artisans and could handle two ships at once. The shipwrights of Buckler’s Hard built HMS Agamemnon, Admiral Horatio Nelson’s favourite ship, in 1781; many of the crew were equally attached to their captain, and followed him to later commands."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_basic_steam_pump	"

Practical “steam engines” that can do useful work offer many advantages over other sources of power such as animals and waterwheels. A beam engine that harnesses the pressure of steam to work a mechanical pump can be used to pump water out of mine workings either more efficiently or from greater depths. In both cases, the profits of the mine are greatly increased.

Historically, there were several almost-abortive attempts to create a “steam pump”, with most of the early efforts being carried out by engineers in Cornwall, England. This county was rich in many mineral ores, and landowners were prepared to pay handsomely for profitable innovations. Captain Thomas Savery (1650-1715) developed a “fire engine” that worked, after a fashion and as well as it could, given the time’s engineering limitations. It was, however, the beam “atmospheric engine” of Thomas Newcomen (1664-1729) that truly harnessed steam power and made miners’ lives safer."	false

They are capable of covering ground quickly, and of using the land and cover to best advantage: hiding behind a blade of grass or a pebble if needs must! While their bows might seem outmoded, their skills give them a good rate of fire and are accurate: an enemy killed by an arrow is as dead as one shot by a musket ball. Armenian archers carry knives to be used in hand-to-hand combat, but they should not be committed to melee without good reason. They are also vulnerable to cavalry attack, and can suffer excessive casualties when facing riflemen or specialist musketeers.

Historically, Ottoman subjects could, and did, declare that they were soldiers by arming themselves and joining an army in the field. They could leave the service without penalty just as easily. What looked like lack of organisation was useful: good leaders attracted followers and kept them. However, provincial troops were not always as loyal to the Sultan in Istanbul as they were to their locality or commander, and there was a regrettable tendency for private, rather than state, armies to flourish."	false

A prospector’s camp is a collection of hardy men, survivors of the worst that the wilds can impose on a man. They are experts at reading the land and finding gold in the most seemingly unlikely of places. Some work with the permission of the native tribes, paying for the right to stake a claim and extract wealth. In return for allowing this small scale invasion of their lands, the tribes get a share of the wealth and power that gold produces.

Gold was one factor that brought Europeans to the Americas in search. While the Spanish never found “El Dorado”, they certainly found gold. Gold ""in them there hills"" was enough to start stampedes of the greedy, the desperate, and everyone else in search of riches. The really big gold rushes were in the 19th Century (California, the Black HIlls of Dakota, and Klondike), but a smaller rush in Georgia was possibly triggered by the native tribes mentioning that they had found gold on their lands. The tribes and their beliefs in the Spirits were brutally ignored in the dash for wealth."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_metalled	"

The road is actually constructed in layers of increasingly large stones (going down through a cross-section), with each layer being compressed by rolling. The end result is a solid path that can drain cleanly. This method is often used for the key strategic and commercial routes between cities and defence points. Tolls are often charged to private users of such excellent roads and turnpikes.

Historically, “metalled roads” were only covered in “tarmac” after 1820, when the idea of using tar to stabilise the top layer of stones was tried by John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), although “tarmac” itself was not called that until 1901!

Road building produced some other interesting characters, such as Blind Jack of Knaresborough, Yorkshire. Although completely sightless thanks to childhood smallpox, John “Jack” Metcalf (1717-1810) was, at various times, a fiddle player, an army recruiter, and a haulier. When a turnpike was built near his birthplace he used his local experience to create a masterpiece of a road, including a section on a raft of logs across a bog. His blindness was no handicap in bringing road projects in on time and to cost, although he was always at a loss to explain to others how he managed his finances so well."	false

War between Austria and the Ottoman Empire was hardly unusual. This time the cause of war was the defensive alliance between Austria and Venice. The Ottomans had attacked and conquered the Venetian possessions in Greece.

The great Austrian general Prince Eugene of Savoy favoured a direct confrontation, and encamped his army at the Austrian-held fort at Petrovaradin.

Despite having the weaker force, Prince Eugene faced a stark choice. Should he strike before Damad Ali’s horde is entrenched, or allow the Ottomans to lose all mobility?"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_conservatorium_european	"

While the emphasis is on music for a cultured and upper class audience, the education provided by a conservatorium is practical and vocational. Those who pay the fees intend to earn a living as musicians, at the very least in the orchestra of a wealthy patron and, at best, as a composer of some renown, able to choose between commissions, patrons and even nations! A conservatorium has to provide what its customers want, and they generally produce well-polished musicians who can pass themselves off, when needed, as professionals or members of the minor gentry.

Historically, many of these schools began as either royal academies of music or choristers’ schools for the great cathedrals. All music had to be performed live, and the need for new, innovative and exciting music at every state or religious event required an enormous number of musicians – and talented composers with prodigious work rates! Great composers, such as Mozart or Handel, were celebrities and royal houses outbid each other in an effort to obtain their services as a prestigious ornament to a court."	false

The land-holding system of the zamindar (the word comes from the Persian for “landholder”) outwardly has much in common with feudal systems common in Europe and Japan. Land tenure is given to office holders and nobles. However, as an overseer of taxes a zamindar only holds his lands as long as he pays the stipulated revenue to the central government. He is, in effect, a tax farmer: his income and profit are dependent solely on his ability to tax his lands. He also carries out judicial and military duties for his tenured lands.

Historically, the zamindari system survived both the end of Muhgal rule and the British Raj. Tax farming allowed the European trading companies to take over as zamindars themselves (and make a profit), even before the Muhgal collapse, as they could pay governments for the right to collect taxes."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_eua_1st_delaware	"

These soldiers carry muzzle-loading, smoothbore muskets firing lead balls as wide as a man’s thumb. These are inaccurate weapons, effective only to around 200 paces when fired in volleys. The ability to fire and reload with machine-like regularity with comrades falling all around is what wins battles; that and an ability to fight in a variety of tactical formations. Any enemy foolhardy enough to charge their cavalry at this unit while they are in square will find them a tough target.

The 1st Delaware regiment came into being in 1776 under the supervision of Colonel John Haslet; they went on to fight in the Battle of Long Island in August of that year. Along with the 1st Maryland Regiment they were able to repel the British, allowing Washington and his troops to make a safe retreat. The Delaware were then forced to make a daring retreat through marshland while escorting 23 prisoners of war. Their action during this battle prompted Washington to appoint them his rear guard when he strategically withdrew his army from Brooklyn to Manhattan."	false

Originally constructed as a palace by Count Emanuel Teles Silva-Tarouca on top of one of Vienna’s bastions, the count must have used his influence as master of the Court Construction Office, otherwise the defences might have been left in place. The building subsequently came into the possession of Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen, the former governor of the Netherlands. He brought his extensive collection of artwork and antiquities back to Vienna from Brussels, and had the palace extended to hold them all.

In 1776 the collection was expanded when the Austrian ambassador in Venice, Giacomo Durazzo, gave around 1000 artworks to Duke Albert, so that they would have a safe home. The Albertina, as the collection and palace became known, survived even the collapse of Hapsburg power in 1918 at the end of the Great War, and the bombing of Vienna in the Second World War. It remains one of Europe’s great art museums."	false

The Europeans brought guns to the Americas, but the native tribes have not been slow to adopt them. A gun is a status symbol for a warrior, and needs care if it is to work properly. The smiths of many tribes have learned to repair and even manufacture firearms, following the invaders’ patterns. 

For the most part, Native American tribes gained guns through trade or from vanquished foes. One of the earliest guns to become available to them was a lightweight, smoothbore, French flintlock musket, thanks to the trading and political policies carried out in New France (Canada). The French gave “their” natives guns in the hopes of discomforting British settlers."	false

Armed with grenades and a powerful throwing arm, the Royal Welch Fusiliers are far more than your average missile troop. Their skills extend past the throwing of highly explosive projectiles, also encompassing the fine art of marksmanship, muskets being the weapon of choice. Although primarily expected to fight at range, fusiliers are also more than capable in melee and on the charge. Their only real weakness is artillery and heavy cavalry who could charge them from the flank or the rear.

The Royal Welch Fusiliers were founded in 1689. At this time they weren’t known as the Fusiliers: this title was not bestowed upon them until 1702. A further addition was to follow after the War of Spanish Succession in 1713, when they became the Royal Welch Fusiliers. This was a variation of “Welsh” used at the time. Later members of the regiment would earn 14 Victoria Crosses (the highest British award for gallantry) and can count famous servicemen and poets Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves amongst their number."	false

Founded on the site of a very fine natural harbour, New York is integral to plans for the building of a canal linking the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean - a scheme that would extensively open up trade on American soil and one which the city would no doubt profit greatly from.

The Dutch Navy owes its existence to the arming of Dutch trading ships in the 16th Century and earlier, often in direct contravention of orders from their Spanish overlords. The independently-minded Dutch were not minded to take much notice of such instructions. A centralised navy, dedicated solely to warfare, could trace its origins back to 1488, and had managed to dominate the seas for much of that time.

A formal training system for officers, however, had to wait until 1785 when this land-based training establishment was opened. Before that, officers had learned their trade at sea, in a very practical way. The whole business was formalised under the short-live Republic of Batavia (1795-1806), although by this time maritime supremacy had passed to the British Royal Navy. Nevertheless, the Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart was one of the most prestigious naval schools, and produced fine officers."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_eua_2nd_dragoons	"

When a friendly unit is being harassed by an enemy beyond its fire range, these cavalrymen can react immediately, riding to the enemy to counter the threat. When mounted they are good in melee, at the charge, and can fire their carbines. They are not very effective in close combat on foot, leaving themselves vulnerable when acting as melee infantry.

The 2nd Continental Light Dragoons were one of the first cavalry units raised in 1776 following Washington’s realisation that the war was going to be far longer than expected. His original plan was to raise 3,000 horsemen, but it soon became obvious that paying and equipping that many horsemen was beyond the resources of Congress. Instead, four small regiments of light dragoons were raised. The 2nd light dragoons were commanded by Colonel Elisha Sheldon, who was commemorated for his efforts by the citizens of Sheldon, Vermont."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_punch-card_loom	"

Patterns are created in woven cloth by lifting different warp threads as the shuttle passes through the loom. Even on a manual loom intricate designs can be created by lifting threads in the right order, but this relies on the skill of the weaver. The punch-card loom mechanizes the lifting of warp threads. A series of punch cards is drawn through the machine as the cloth is woven; each card has an intricate pattern of holes that allow levers to drop through as the card is “read”. The lever trips a mechanism that raises the corresponding warp thread at the right time to create a pattern. Providing the cards are in the correct order and the holes properly punched, the machine can dependably and repeatedly produce any desired design with no need for a master weaver.

Joseph Marie Jacquard (1752-1834) is credited as the father of the punched card loom, although his work draws on machines that used a paper roll for the instructions. The loom cards are direct ancestors of the computer punched card, once the bane of every computer department!"	false

Following that, capturing Flanders would not only expel the Spanish from northern Europe, it would also unite all Netherlanders under a single banner. It is important to make and maintain alliances with other Protestant nations - you are already allied to Britain by virtue of William of Orange’s position on the throne of England, and the military might of Prussia could make them an important ally. You should also try to expand your colonial possessions in the Caribbean Sea. Trade is an essential part of Dutch culture, so keep sending Indiaman merchant ships to the Trade Theatres in the South Atlantic, East Indies, off the coast of Africa, and your colonies in the Caribbean and Ceylon.

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1886952522	Your first priority should be to bolster your armies through recruitment in order to adequately patrol France's extensive borders. The Alsace region to the east could be under threat - the inhabitants are largely German-speakers, so Prussia or Austria may try to take it back in an attempt to forge a single German Empire. However, a protracted land war with either of these nations may prove unwise, despite the strength and reputation of the French army. The territories of the Holy Roman Empire to the east are good Catholic populations under the corrupt yolk of heretic Lutheran masters. As such, the territories of Rhineland and Wurttemburg are potential targets for a Catholic French army wishing to bring the true religion back to the faithful. Also look to expand your foothold in the new worlds of America and India before the British colonise both continents – therefore becoming too powerful to keep in check. There are still unexplored native territories on the American continent, although the Spanish have begun expansion in that direction - so time is of the essence. In India the landscape is changing – the old Mughal Empire is starting to collapse and lose territory to their Maratha rivals. The British, Dutch and Portuguese are all active in this theatre, so you should make alliances and secure territory before they do. Make trade agreements in order to sell your colonial resources, open as many trade routes as possible between France and her colonies, and patrol routes against attack as much as possible. An alliance with Spain may also be fruitful, acting as a counter-balance to the current British monopoly in America.	false

Members of a Warrior Society are the tribal equivalent of professional soldiers. The most practiced and deadly men in the tribe, they have a position of great power. They provide military leadership and war chiefs are chosen from their ranks to keep discipline, organise hunting parties and oversee ceremonies. 

Warrior societies quickly gained a reputation for unrelenting ferociousness. They would literally tether themselves to one spot on a battlefield, and not move until the battle was over. They would battle against any enemy that came at them and never even consider retreat. They were skilled with a number of weapons including the tomahawk and the war club."	false

The ship is a good sailer, as befits a design coming from a seafaring nation like Holland.

Historically, the fluyt was originated by Dutch shipbuilders, and the type helped the Dutch to become a maritime trading nation in the 17th Century. Extensively used by the Dutch trading companies, it was soon adopted by other nations. The vessels were easy for a relatively small crew to handle, and could carry around a dozen cannon for self-defence, although these were sometimes left ashore so that even more cargo could be carried.

The fluyt had a distinctive “fat-bottomed” cross section. This was a cunning scheme to avoid taxes and tolls, as the Danish had a habit of charging tolls based on deck area for access to the straits between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. A small deck (the big cargo hold below counted for nothing) meant lower taxes! The Dutch had to pay these tolls if they wanted access to any of the lucrative Baltic trade."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_ordnance_factory_european	"

The large-scale manufacturing of cannons is a monopoly often retained by the state, even in a republic: there is no need for anyone other than a government to own large cannons! The creation of large guns is also a difficult and expensive business, and the state is the only authority that can afford to do it. The number of guns available is therefore a measure of national prestige, and the ability to produce guns (rather than buy them from foreigners) is equally prestigious. An ordnance factory adds lustre and firepower to armies.

Historically, most ordnance factories began as royal establishments, giving the crown in each nation a source of cannons. These were needed for reducing the castles of recalcitrant barons! Even though politics moved on, the state control of cannon production remained. The royal household or near-ministerial status of the Master Gunner or Master of the Ordnance is proof that artillery was an important part of national or royal prestige. Size really did matter! The Ottoman Turks had a strong tradition of artillery production, in particular heavy siege guns."	false

battles_description_battle_of_mellazo	"Following the end of The War of Spanish Succession, Spain lost its Italian territories thanks to the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Not surprisingly, King Philip V of Spain was intent on regaining these lands. Having recaptured Sardinia the previous year, the Spanish landed on Sicily in July 1718.

On the morning of 15 October 1718, the Spanish army under the Marquis de Lede was camped around the city of Mellazo. However, unknown to the Spanish, their fleet had been beaten by the British at Cape Passaro. The Royal Navy had then landed an Austrian army, under Count Wirich von Daun, to lift the siege.

The Marquis de Lede was completely surprised by the Austrian attack and, with no possibility of help from Spanish forces to the West faced a desperate Battle. Can you delay the Austrians and regroup the scattered Spanish forces?"	false

By their very nature, line infantry are vulnerable to bombardment from artillery and sniping from skirmishers; it takes a special kind of courage to stand and carefully fire volleys at the enemy then dispatch them with a bayonet charge. Extensive drill, training and battle have helped mould these men into soldiers, capable of dealing with the enemy on equal terms.

Historically, the 1st Maryland regiment was raised to protect the province of Maryland and came under the command of Colonel William Smallwood. In July 1776 the troops were assigned to the main Continental Army and in the months that followed they joined Stirling’s Brigade. They took part in the Battle of Guildford Courthouse, but it was at the Battle of Long Island that they earned their formidable reputation. They single-handedly covered the American retreat, holding off superior numbers of British regulars."	false

These light-fingered cavalrymen are irregular forces, deployed where courage and speed are required, and mounted on the best horses. Their disciplinary shortcomings can be overlooked as long as they fight as if captained by the Devil himself! Looting is second nature to these men, and is (possibly rightly) considered a second source of pay. The other, unsavoury activities associated with pillage are equally considered a right, not a perquisite. This reputation for lawlessness often counts against them.

Although they have their origins in the Balkans, as the name suggests, “Bosniak” lancers can include men from many nations. Historically, the prototype for this unit was raised by an Albanian, Stephen Serkis, who recruited a force of lancers originally intended for Saxon service. He then offered his men to Frederick the Great (1740-86) of Prussia. Even though Frederick thoroughly disapproved of irregular troops in Prussian service, he took them into his army, and later recruited Poles, Lithuanians and Tatars to replenish the ranks. The regiment was eventually amalgamated into various other light cavalry forces by the beginning of the 19th Century."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_militia_infantry_minutemen	"

Minutemen are so called because they pride themselves on being ready to defend their homes and families within a minute of being alerted to danger. This somewhat optimistic claim should not, however, underestimate their ability to inflict damage on enemies with their long rifled muskets. They are adept at using what cover is available, and at sniping from that cover.

Historically, the minutemen were among the first American forces to engage British regular troops during the American War of Independence (1775-1783). Their thoroughly unsporting habit of not standing in line to get shot was much despised by their British opponents. Had the Geneva Convention applied at the time, the minutemen could have been shot out of hand as “illegal combatants” because they certainly did not wear uniforms.

It can be argued that the success of the minutemen gave rise to the Second Amendment of the US Constitution (the right to keep and bear arms), although it is often forgotten that the text mentions a “well regulated militia” as “being necessary” which, it could also be argued, might not be quite the same as everyone who wants one having a gun. The name “Minuteman” was recently revived as the name of a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile in USAF service."	false

Blackfoot Blood Warriors charge headlong into enemy lines bellowing fearsome war cries to terrify their enemies. They are experts at hand-to-hand fighting, and little use for anything else. Even the clothes they wear are designed to frighten and intimidate: Blood Warriors wear traditional war shirts emblazoned with symbolic representations depicting their victories in battle. These give the wearer the protection of the Spirits. They also provide an illustrated guide to all the reasons why an enemy should know fear!

Warrior societies played a key role in the day to day life of young Native Americans. The Blackfoot Blood Warrior society, or “aiinikiks” (meaning “all comrades”), was a “graded” society. When a group of boys reached fighting age they would present the most junior members of the society with gifts in order to “purchase” positions. Once a deal had been struck between two fighters they would smoke a pipe to seal the deal. The warrior that had sold his position would then present gifts to a man in the grade above him, and move up in status."	false

Their carbines fire a smaller ball than the muskets of infantrymen, but it is still large enough to maim and kill a target. Having the speed of light cavalry, these men are a useful force for any general: they can be moved quickly to a key part of the line to give fire, and then redeployed with equal speed. They are also remarkably difficult opponents for heavy cavalry; it is hard to come to grips with an enemy who can simply outpace you!

Historically, the carbine was only a smaller calibre version of an infantry musket. The idea to cut down the barrel only emerged when it became clear that reloading a full-length musket on horseback was a horrible job, even if the enemy weren’t trying to kill you at the same time. Attaching the carbine to the user by a sling finally made it into a very practical, deadly weapon."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_grenade_launchers	"

Despite its name, the hand mortar is more of a grenade launcher, with a wide barrel, typically of bronze, mounted on a musket stock so that it can be fired from the shoulder. This method of delivery offers increased range, but the weapons are temperamental and prone to misfires or bursting. This, coupled with the variable quality of the grenades fired, means that in the wrong hands a hand mortar can often be as much of a danger to the man firing it as to the enemy. Despite this, the grenade is a useful battlefield weapon when used against enemies deployed in cover, or for clearing choke points.

Historically the armies of the Ottoman Empire and Russia employed the hand mortar. In the Russian military, hand mortar detachments typically operated in support of the artillery, possibly because the unpredictability of the weapon made it unpopular among the line regiments! The Ottomans always treated grenades as a form of “thrown artillery”."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_hussars_hungarian_hussars	"

Like other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards enemies. Hungarian hussars are, without exception, superb equestrians, as might be expected for a Magyar force. Their organisational origin as irregular forces (reputedly recruited from among brigands) gives them a certain independence of spirit, something that aids them in reconnaissance work. They carry a curved sabre and a muzzle-loading smoothbore carbine. This is a smaller calibre weapon than an infantry musket, the “sawn off” length of carbines being a late development to make reloading on horseback an easier exercise.

Austria had raised units of irregular Magyar horsemen called “huszárok” in the mid-15th Century, and they had fought bravely for Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary and Croatia and Duke of Austria, but it was not until the 1680s that regular hussar regiments were formed. Having proved their utility in Austrian service, other nations soon added hussars to their own armies – and enthusiastically adopted hussar uniform as a fashion statement for cavalrymen. In some armies, hussar uniforms grew ever more gaudy, exaggerated and, frankly, needlessly suggestive in the cut of the very tight breeches! The cavalrymen didn’t mind at all that they were being dressed up like peacocks, as a splendid uniform was always useful in attracting the ladies!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_guard_infantry	"

These troops are equipped in much the same way as line infantrymen, and carry smoothbore muskets as their primary weapons. There, however, the similarities end. Their uniforms are altogether more splendid, marking them out as a superior force, in arrogance if nothing else. This attitude can serve them well in battle, as the guard can hardly be seen to be cutting and running, no matter how hot the enemy fire. They are also expected to do a good job as garrison troops, keeping the royal family safe no matter what the locals might think or be tempted to do by some foolish revolutionary fervour.

Historically, the French Maison du Roi (literally “house of the king”) were the epitome of household troops. They provided a ceremonial guard at every state occasion, and Louis XIV picked them from candidates sent in by each regiment; inappropriate candidates brought punishment on the officers who had sent them! The Prussian “Potsdam Giants” were a quirky household guard, the product of Frederick I’s obsession with very, very tall men and military pomp. Oddly, he wasn’t a very warlike chap at all."	false

The Europeans brought guns to the Americas, but the native tribes have not been slow to adopt them. A gun is a status symbol for a warrior, and needs care if it is to work properly. The smiths of many tribes have learned to repair and even manufacture firearms, following the invaders’ patterns. 

For the most part, Native American tribes gained guns through trade or from vanquished foes. One of the earliest guns to become available to them was a lightweight, smoothbore, French flintlock musket, thanks to the trading and political policies carried out in New France (Canada). The French gave “their” natives guns in the hopes of discomforting British settlers."	false

events_event_text_cast_steel	"While searching for a better kind of steel to use in his workings, clockmaker Benjamin Huntsman has discovered a process for producing harder, purer steel than any currently in production.

While the details are a closely guarded secret, it is known that the method involves heating and cooling iron in large clay crucibles. To obtain a cheaper source for the coke that fuels his furnaces, Mr. Huntsman has recently relocated to Handsworth, near Sheffield. Certainly the cutlery makers of that town will benefit from the close proximity of this high quality ""crucible steel"".

However, it should be noted that whereas this is an innovation in the West, steel of this quality - or ""wootz"" - has been produced in India for generations. Indeed, the Indian process uses crucibles in a remarkably similar way and has apparently been practiced since the fourth century."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_cuirassiers	"

These are big men, mounted on big horses, and their primary task is to crash into enemy forces and engage in hand-to-hand combat. To this end, they wear back- and breastplates over leather padding – the cuirass – and usually wear reinforced metal helmets too. Heavy straight swords are the weapons of choice. A wise commander with a cuirassier force under his hand keeps it as a battering ram to hit the enemy at the critical point.

Historically, armoured cavalry were the direct functional descendants of armoured knights and the three-quarter-armoured “lobsters” of 16th Century armies.

Despite the military mania for neatness and order, nearly all cuirasses had a small dent in them. This was the proofing mark, where a pistol ball had been fired into the cuirass to “prove” that it worked as armour. A cuirass with a hole in it after this test would be thrown back into the furnace!

Cuirassiers still exist in modern armies, although their armour is now purely ceremonial. The French army still has two regiments of cuirassiers, the Italians have a Presidential Honour Guard, and technically the Household Cavalry in the British army are also cuirassiers."	false

Mounted on tireless light horses and armed with scimitars, they are commonly employed to harass an enemy force, restricting its space to manoeuvre easily. Once battle is fully joined, they will often time their charges to coincide with those of a supporting infantry unit, seeking to break the enemy quickly then wreaking havoc amongst them as they flee.

Mamelukes were traditionally slave soldiers of the various caliphs and sultans of the Middle Ages, captured as children and raised in the Islamic faith to provide their master with a force of men unconnected to any other part of the hierarchy. Over time, the Mamelukes accrued power of their own and even went as far as seizing control of Egypt; they founded a Mameluke Sultanate in 1250. Though the Mamelukes’ strength enabled the Sultanate to repel several invasions by Christian crusaders and Mongols, it was eventually overpowered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517. The Mamelukes so came into the service of the Sublime Porte."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_seminary_catholic	"

The syllabus concentrates on giving students the theological, spiritual and philosophical tools needed to carry out their duties, as well as a solid “Classical” education to produce men who will be well-respected members of society. Where science and the natural world are touched upon, it is always with an emphasis on how they reveal God’s grand plan of creation. A seminary is not intended to produce an enquiring mind, only a very disciplined one.

Historically, the seminary system owes its existence to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, a movement that aimed to defeat the heretical, Protestant views of Martin Luther and his ilk. The Council of Trent had recognised education as a weapon in its struggles against schism. The Church required an educated and intelligent group of priests, who could argue successfully in its defence. While the 18th Century is seen as the “age of Enlightenment”, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had yet to play themselves out completely and the Church’s place in the hearts of men, affairs of state and God’s universe was still open to argument. In parts of Europe, the Catholic Church was still a tremendous force for social, political and scientific conservatism."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_east_ethnic_musketeers_bargir	"

With their equipment paid for by the state and their organisation based on tried and tested European principles, Bargir infantry are more reliable than most Indian foot soldiers. Armed with good muskets and often trained or led by mercenary European officers, Bargirs provide their general with a range of tactical options on the battlefield.

Traditionally, armies on the Indian subcontinent were geared toward mounted troops who enjoyed a high status compared to infantry. Footsoldiers, mainly drawn from the lowest echelons of society, were typically a disorganised rabble, useful to a commander only because they added numbers to an army. They were expendable, poorly-equipped and easily-dismayed in battle, often making them a liability rather than an asset.

The social mobility which characterised Maratha society allowed a more modern view of the role of infantry to come to prevalence. Through observation of European methods, the equipment and training of Maratha infantry began to improve, allowing the successful use of advanced manoeuvres and firing drills."	false

Renowned for their stoic resolve, Guard Grenadiers can be relied on not to break under the strain of battle. Apart from anything else, throwing grenades is a dangerous business, but potentially devastating to the enemy. Strength is also needed in hand-to-hand combat, and Guard Grenadiers are a useful force of shock troops to be hurled against a wavering enemy. Their skills and physical presence makes them intimidating, even before steel is drawn.

The 18th Century was a period when there were attempts to codify and define every aspect of military life to the smallest detail. Everything, from the smallest button on a uniform, to the way a man marched, was subject to discussion, regulation, and draconian punishment for deviation. The Polish Guard Grenadiers were subject to rigorous drill in every aspect of their training. The throwing drill for grenades had stances to be adopted when priming, igniting and throwing a grenade. Woe betide any Grenadier who did not follow the laid down procedure! Equally, woe betide any man who failed to dress to the appropriate standard, or behave as expected of a Guardsman!"	false

events_event_text_guillotine_invented	"A number of bloody executions utilising such arcane and barbarous methods as hanging, breaking on the wheel, drawing and quartering with horses, and burning at the stake have recently caused unrest amongst the common people.

In one case, the crowd attacked the executioner, set the prisoner free and burned the wheel he was to be broken upon. Dr Joseph-Ignace Guillotin has since proposed a move towards a more ""humane"" form of execution, where the gruesome spectacle is replaced by clean efficiency.

As such, he has proposed a system not unlike the Halifax Gibbet or the Scottish Maiden, where a fixed, weighted blade falls onto the neck of the victim, decapitating them relatively cleanly. Modifying this system by use of a curved blade, Antoine Louis has designed a machine commissioned to deliver decapitation with a single blow and no misses.

Despite early calls for it to be named the ""Louison"" or ""Louisette"" the machine has been named ""Guillotine"", somewhat to the chagrin of its namesake, who wasn’t involved in the design itself."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_dust_tracks	"

As a means of travel, the main benefit of a track is that it leads somewhere, probably – without local knowledge, it can be difficult to tell! Without signposts or markers, there is little to distinguish one path from another. Even local knowledge of a route can be limited, because locals rarely travel further than the nearest market town and possibly not even that far. The actual going is a little better than across open ground because at least large rocks and bushes have been removed. In wet weather, however, it may be considerably worse as the track turns to a muddy streambed.

Historically, these roads were often little more than drover’s tracks or country lanes that have been worn into the landscape by centuries of use. While perfectly adequate to local needs, they were not suitable for military purposes: heavy cannons in particular require solid going if they are to be moved at more than a snail’s pace, or at all!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_1st_rate_admiral	"

While these warships are among the most powerful vessels afloat, they are poor sailors, being both slow and unresponsive. This is not a serious shortcoming because, armed with around 100 cannons firing 32-, 24- and 18-pounder balls on their three decks, they can fire a terrible and destructive broadside. They carry a crew of over 800 sailors, gunners and marines and have more artillery than most land armies. Their cost, however, is a drawback and few navies can afford to build or maintain more than a handful of them. Their great size, however, means that an admiral and his staff can be carried with little disruption to the normal working of the ship.

One first rate flagship never even reached the sea! The British Royal Navy’s HMS St Lawrence was built, launched and served only on Lake Ontario. Shallow rapids meant that few vessels could reach the lake from the sea, and Niagara Falls prevented any ship from leaving the lake in the other direction."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_indiaman	"

The Indiaman is a three-masted, square-rigged sailing ship of some 1000 tons displacement. Although work for the relatively small crew is hard, there are compensations: they can trade goods in their own right, and make excellent profits by doing so. 

Unusually for a merchant ship, an Indiaman carries cargo, passengers, and a good number of guns. Intended to sail from Europe to the other side of the world and back carrying valuable – sometimes priceless – cargoes, these ships have to be able to defend themselves. The passengers expect some creature comforts, being both officers of the owning trade companies and assorted “gentlemen” seeking their fortunes in foreign parts.

Historically, East Indiamen resembled ships of the line, both in their general configuration and paintwork. At the Battle of Pulo Aura (1804), the ambiguous appearance and aggressive handling of a squadron of British Indiamen completely humbugged the French admiral, Charles-Alexandre Linois. He withdrew in the face of “superior” forces. Commodore Nathaniel Dance, of the British Company fleet, received a knighthood and a handsome reward for his cunning.

National navies purchased Indiamen and converted them into troopships or warships."	false

For instance, in the recently re-conquered Hungary and Croatia you may be required to immediately restore public order to satisfactory levels, along with missionaries to halt the spread of Islam in those regions. These regions certainly require urgent military reinforcement. Protestantism is spreading like a disease through the German regions of Rhineland, Hannover, and Saxony - and although many people still follow the true religion, in some cases their heretical rulers do not. If too many of the population convert to Protestantism, invade their territory and bring the true religion back to the people. There may also be the possibility of expansion to the north and east, especially if Protestant Prussia tries to unite German-speaking lands under their banner. They may also try to partition Poland for the same reason. If this occurs Russia could also act against Poland, so it may be necessary to invade Poland to prevent the Prussian and Russian empires from becoming too large.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_libyan_kuloglu	"

They also carry sabres, which can be used when in the saddle, giving the ability to fight well in melee. Unlike some other Turkish and Ottoman troops, they do not wear armour. Their blunderbusses are large-bore flintlock weapons, much like giant shotguns, and cannot be used from horseback. They have a very short range but a blast from one, let alone a volley from a whole unit, is terrible. This weapon makes the kuloglu a superb attacking force, if they can get within range of the target. They suffer when facing troops with longer-ranged muskets or rifles.

Historically, the kuloglu were recruited from the sons of ethnic Turkish janissaries and local, Libyan women. These men were specifically excluded from joining the ranks of the prestigious janissaries, proving their worth by fighting with bravery and discipline - particularly during the American attack on Tripoli. Indeed, kuloglu who behaved in a cowardly way were made to dress as women until they redeemed themselves through acts of not-quite-suicidal bravery, or died in the attempt. This, however, was mild compared to what was done to any who “abused” young prisoners taken in battle: the offender was beheaded or beaten 1000 times with a stout cane, something that was surely a protracted death sentence!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_steam_drydock_european	"

The kind of beam engines used to pump water around a canal system (and drain mines) can drain a drydock efficiently. Using steam to power these engines is an obvious step, but once steam engines are in a dockyard their use goes far beyond pumping seawater around. 

They can be used to drive sawmills, lathes, even block-making machines and as the lifting power for dockside cranes. The efficiency gains – admittedly with some new risk of fire, as the main shipbuilding material is wood – are impressive! 

The scale of the military-naval industry could be huge in maritime nations, even discounting civilian yards. The British Royal Navy dockyards were the largest industrial organisation in the world during the 18th Century, and could make every part of a warship from a mast to a nail; guns were the exception, as they came from the Board of Ordnance. The ropewalk at Chatham, Kent, produced anchor ropes and was the longest brick building in Europe when constructed. It is still producing high quality ropes for ships today. The dockyards were so important that damaging them by fire or explosion carried the death penalty – something not actually repealed until 1971 (two years after the UK death penalty was finally abolished for murder)."	false

The development of new cannons is an expensive and sometimes risky business, and one that the state likes to keep under its immediate control. No government likes to contemplate rebellion, but central control of heavy artillery and its production is a wise policy. Rebels without cannons are an annoyance: with large guns, rebels can become revolutionaries!

Large guns are necessary for armies (and navies, for that matter) to operate effectively. The ability of a nation to project its power in war is, in large part, measured by the size and variety of its artillery train.

Historically, the arsenals of many states were peacetime stores for cannons, shot and powder; domestic peacekeeping by an army rarely required artillery. Once cast, a cannon barrel could spend decades in storage before being mounted on a carriage and used in anger. Gunpowder, too, could spend neglected years in storage, and this caused all kinds of problems when it was finally issued to gunners. Money for the upkeep of stores also caused problems, too often ending up in the pockets of the Masters of Ordnance and his friends!"	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_anti_clericism	"

Anti-clericism seeks to reduce the power of the Church in politics and everyday life. This can range from ending fines for non-observance, closing down religious law courts to try clergy accused of crimes, toleration of religious freedom of conscience, and an end to bishops having any say in the legislative process. In an absolutist state, where the monarch is assumed to benefit from divine approval, this can be tantamount to disloyalty. Anti-clericists also seek to reduce the hidden, whispering power of the Church: the influence, connections and wealth that it uses to see that its interests are protected by the secular authorities, even at the cost of personal liberties and national interest. In short: this is a philosophy that wishes to confine the priesthood to purely devotional duties. Some followers of this creed wish religion destroyed altogether.

Historically, anti-clericism reached its height during the French Revolution, when Catholic priests were seen as defenders of the Bourbon regime. Large numbers of priests were beaten, tried or executed: the Church had protected its wealth and defended social injustice."	false

Whilst Wesley has always maintained that he lives and dies as a member of the Anglican faith, this act is widely seen as officially dividing Anglicans and Methodists into two separate churches. Methodists base their faith around a belief in freewill and a determination to include worshippers from every section of society. Members are organised into local societies, and these are subdivided into classes for mutual instruction. Good works are seen as essential to the worship of God, as is missionary work.

Many fear the passion of Methodist preaching, which at times strays perilously close to enthusiasm, and as such represents a threat to the established order."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_selective_breeding	"

The simple ideas are often the most effective: by separating a farm’s herds by sex, animals cannot breed as nature intended and the inclination takes them. The farmer can select the male animal used to impregnate his flock or herd, and choose the good characteristics he wants the next generation to inherit! By repeatedly selecting the “father of the flock” for his good and profitable qualities, the worth of the whole flock increases over each generation.

Robert Bakewell (1725 - 1795) was the first to try this simple scheme at his farm in Leicestershire, England. His new breeds, Dishley Longhorn cattle and English Leicester sheep were only popular during his lifetime, but the pattern had been set. New crossbreeds replaced them, and the size and yields of farm animals increased dramatically. Perhaps a touch ironically, the modern trend is to preserve ancient farming bloodstock types, in the hope that they may have benefits for today’s farmers."	false

By holding onto a crop until a market is “right”, plantation owners can get the best price for their harvest. They can also calm the volatility of the commodity’s market by evening out the supply over the course of a year, rather than having a harvest glut and then a shortage for the rest of the time. A warehouse also allows plantation owners to wait until the season and winds are favourable for a fast sea journey back to the homeland; shipping losses and transit times are both reduced. Finally, Warehousing also allows smaller crops to be consolidating for shipping back to the home market, and for the crop to be properly graded. The finest parts of the harvest can be sold at the highest price, rather than simply being lumped in with any old dross."	false

Such men have little to do with standard military protocols and practice, or even organisation, often taking up arms in extraordinary circumstances. This lack of discipline means that they can sometimes be extremely brutal, even brutish, in their behaviour. This can work in their favour, in that it gives enemies pause for thought. More typically, their lack of discipline counts against them, and faced with a well-ordered force they can be at a disadvantage. In such a case, their mobility can be a boon, allowing them to harass an enemy and withdraw as soon as the fight goes against them."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_square_formation	"

As the name suggests, this is four two- or three-rank lines of infantry arranged as a hollow square, with everyone facing outwards. It is a version of the obsolete pike “hedgehog”, making any cavalry charge a suicidal exercise. Bayonets are fixed to muskets when appropriate and possible.

Forming a square requires good order in the ranks. The outer companies of an infantry unit in line have to “fold back” to form the sides and back of the square, without losing cohesion in the process. The unit colours take up station in the centre, a final rallying point should the square be broken. It is also possible to form larger squares with more than one unit.

The square is, of course, a tempting target for enemy artillery. Whether it is better to form square in the face of cavalry and risk an artillery barrage, or stay in line to mitigate artillery fire and risk a cavalry charge can be a tactical conundrum!

Theoreticians argued infantry could defeat a cavalry charge by firepower alone. Brigadier General Richard Kane (later Military Governor of Gibraltar) remarked, “If a body of Foot have but Resolution and keep their Order, there is no Body of Horse dare venture within their Fire…” but for him that fire was to be delivered from a square, not a line. He was arguing for discipline as the key to success."	false

A spirit circle is a centre of sacred power that has been blessed by a spiritual leader or Shaman. Entry to these circles is only from the east, and once inside the sacred dancers move round the circle in the same direction as the path of the sun through the sky.

Spirituality was, and still is, a deeply important aspect of Native American life. Many believed that there were three levels of spirit orders, the first being spirits on earth. Every being was said to have the power of the spirits within them. These were in turn controlled by the final level of spirits; those that oversee the whole universe."	false

Secular humanists hold that things should not be taken on blind faith, and religion should be taken into consideration only for each individual and not society as a whole. Although humanists seek to remove religion from its deeply ingrained position in society, they do treat it with the same careful deliberation they apply to all their investigations. Everything is looked at in a critical, careful, and most importantly, “scientific” way.

The doctrine of secular humanism also seeks to improve society through reason, an open exchange of ideas and tolerance. If a society is built up of individuals who feel fulfilled it will function better on the whole than one which concentrates on the greater good.

Historically, the term “secularism” was invented by George Holyoake (1817-1906) in an attempt to explain as inoffensively as possible this concept about religion and its place in society. Before that, it was termed “Owenite” after Robert Owen (1771-1858) and his trenchant opposition to organised religion. Holyoake had spent six months imprisoned for blasphemy, after explaining the concept in a public lecture."	false

The college exists to provide the practical mathematics needed for safe navigation, a theoretical understanding of the mysteries of ship handling (a complex subject, given the rigging of most ships), gunnery, swordsmanship, the manners of gentlemen, some Classics, perhaps a foreign language, and the laws and usages of war. The final product is a junior officer who is presentable, but not necessarily entirely useful aboard a ship! A stupid or ill-prepared man could sink his ship and kill his crew as surely as any enemy, and to master their chosen profession newly-minted officers must go to sea.

In the 18th Century, virtually every navy recognised the need for professional naval officers. While men who had nothing more to offer than good breeding could do a fine job in command of armies, ships’ captains really needed to know their jobs, otherwise their careers really would end on the rocks! The better navies of the time operated as a “moderated meritocracy” – influence and connections still counted, but ability, training and character counted for more."	false

events_event_text_big_bottom_massacre	"Big Bottom, a new settlement on the Muskingum River in Ohio, has come under attack from a native war party, resulting in the brutal deaths of eleven men, one woman and two children; as well as the capture of three others. A handful of survivors were forced to flee for their lives.

Despite the existence of a treaty between native tribes and settlers, areas in Ohio are still disputed. This has not stopped the Ohio Company of Associates from proceeding with its program of settlement there however, although the financial strain has led to under-investment. This regrettable situation may go some way towards explaining why the settlers kept such a poor watch over Big Bottom, and why they had not even completed the construction of the blockhouse.

The tragedy could have been much worse if not for the actions of Colonel William Stacy of Marietta, who skated thirty miles up the icy river to bring word of the impending attack to his two sons, only one of whom was to survive the massacre."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sheep_clearances_european	"

Tenanted farms can only generate so much income from rents. With an increase in town size, and an increased demand from industry for agricultural products, it is more profitable to have herds of animals, not a gaggle of tenants. Meat and wool demand increases rapidly as towns grow. Apart from any other considerations, moving people off land also creates large areas where landowners can indulge a passion for hunting. While this generates little income, it does give social status.

The “Highland Clearances” are probably the most famous example of a forced change to land usage on a large scale. Contrary to popular belief, Highland clan leaders carried out most of the Scottish clearances, driving their own kinsmen and clans into exile. The chieftains needed to pay for the sophisticated life that they could have in Edinburgh and London by reinventing themselves as Scottish gentry. Sheep simply earned more money than the crofters did."	false

You will need to expand your armed forces in order to protect them. The heretic United Provinces have already risen up and reclaimed part of their homeland, it may only be a matter of time before they move against Flanders, so building up your forces there may also be wise - although provoking the French or British by your actions there may be unavoidable. In addition to its European possessions, Spain should also maintain trade routes to its Caribbean colonies and the protectorate of New Spain - at the same time protecting them from both the United Provinces and Britain, who are very active in the region.

technologies_long_description_military_army_new_model_bayonet_drill	"

The first bayonets did a fine job of providing musketeers with the equivalent of a short pike to use in an emergency. Because they were pike replacements, the drills used were largely based on the well-known and understood pike drills. Now, however, bayonets are seen as something more than substitute pikes, something that pragmatic soldiers discovered for themselves. New books are emerging, advocating a new fashion of bayonet drill: holding the bayonet-carrying musket at waist height, rather than advancing with it levelled at shoulder height. There is also an emphasis on the offensive use of the bayonet, carrying the fight to the enemy, rather than using it defensively to keep attackers at bay. In the thick of hand-to-hand fighting, however, many soldiers use their muskets as clubs, as the need to live takes precedence over formal training!

Historically, this development is the birth of the “spirit of the bayonet” and the belief in the efficacy of “cold steel” which was to last for the next two centuries in some armies."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_local_fishery_european	"

A local fishery, however, only takes fish from the waters nearby, and most fishermen use small work boats, thus limiting the overall size of the catch. There is always a surplus that can be sent inland to supplement local food supplies. While catches can be seasonal as the fish come and go according to the tides and currents, it is rare for the catch to fail completely. Fishing is a dangerous activity: each year the sea claims its share of the fishing fleet and the lives of many men.

Historically, fish was an important food staple all around the world. There were religious prescriptions that encouraged the eating of fish such as the Catholic requirement not to eat flesh on a Friday. Islamic jurisprudence sees fish with scales as halal (permissible), while some authorities hold that shelled sea creatures are haraam (forbidden). Given the bottom-dwelling nature of mussels, clams, and so on and the inherent risk of food poisoning if they are improperly stored or cooked, this is a sensible precaution."	false

events_event_text_montgolfier_balloon	"Paper-makers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier of Annonay have constructed a contraption to enable manned flight using hot air channelled into a large taffeta cloth bag.

During the first test flight, the brothers lost control of the ""balloon"", which floated over a mile before crashing. It was then destroyed by some bemused onlookers, presumably under the premise that they were preventing an invasion by the dreaded Moon people. The Montgolfiers then decided on a public demonstration, so a new balloon was constructed of sack-cloth lined with paper. This time the flight took ten minutes and covered a similar distance as before.

Now Etienne took a third balloon to Paris for further demonstration. Named ""Aerostat Reveillon"" after the brothers’ collaborator Jean-Baptiste Reveillon - this time the carrying animals in a basket attachment. A chicken, a duck and a sheep were the lucky voyagers, travelling over two miles in an eight minute flight from Versaille. Despite evidence that the structure was unstable, the animals survived the journey safely - in fact the sheep wasn't even aware a journey had taken place!

The fourth balloon was even larger and designed to carry people, so a doctor and an army officer volunteered for the flight, covering nine miles and only landing when the fire began to ignite the balloon's paper lining. Plans are now afoot to develop the balloons for military purposes."	false

events_event_text_robinson_crusoe_published	"The writer Daniel Defoe has been catapulted to fame and public adulation following the publishing of his novel ""The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"".

The tale is a fictional autobiography of a sailor who is marooned on a desert island for twenty eight years. After a variety of adventures the mariner returns to England, where he settles happily for the rest of his days.

Defoe’s inspiration for the story may have come from the real experiences of Alexander Selkirk, himself marooned for four years on a Pacific island at the beginning of this century. However, the tale is more than just a simple adventure story. In his efforts to survive on the island, Crusoe brings enlightened thinking to bear, fortified by the Holy Bible - which is at first his only companion. When he is joined by the native Man Friday, Crusoe begins the process of bringing enlightened thought to the savage.

Though a few radicals might wonder whether Friday gained anything by being thus ""civilised"", Robinson Crusoe can be viewed as a symbolic representation of colonisation - carving out the new world from a wilderness."	false

Although normally robust in health, Handel had been blind for several years and there had been no protracted illness preceding his death. Unusually for a non-Briton, Handel has been buried at Westminster Abbey, a monument by the French sculptor Louis-Francois Roubiliac adorning his tomb in the great crypt.

Handel will always be remembered as one of the great masters of music - his compositions displaying a simplicity of melody and structural clarity rarely matched by those of his contemporaries."	false

An elder is expected to be able to walk between the two worlds of men and spirits. Being able to bring back knowledge from the other world sets such a man apart and gives him wisdom which may belie his years. Many elders have spent the seasons of their lives on spirit quests, and have learned much. 

All decisions, even the smallest must go to the Council of Elders before any action can be taken. From the small to the great, everything must be considered: from marriages requiring the approval of the council to the blessing of this year’s hunting."	false

events_event_text_whitneys_cotton_gin	"American inventor Eli Whitney's new machine seems set to transform the cotton trade. As such he has acquired a patent for a cotton engine or ""gin"" - a device for automating the difficult process of separating cotton fibres from their sticky pods and seeds.

A series of wire hooks mounted on a rotating drum draw the fibres through a screen, whilst wire brushes mounted on a second drum continuously remove the loose lint which would otherwise hinder the mechanism.

It is anticipated that this new invention will greatly aid the efficiency of the cotton production process and lower current manpower requirements. So useful in fact that Mr Whitney has already had to file a number of lawsuits for breach of patent by unscrupulous cotton producers attempting to use unlicensed versions of his machine."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_steppe_cavalry	"

There is a long tradition on the steppes of fighting from horseback. Children are put in the saddle before they can walk, and this makes them almost part of the horse. In previous centuries, accurately firing a bow while riding at speed requires a man who has exceptional ability with both the weapon and a horse. Steppe warriors can control their horses using their knees, and without the need to hold the reins they can use weapons easily and well. Their tactics have always involved galloping up to a slower enemy, delivering a devastating volley, and then riding away again. This way of warfare has survived in the era of pistols and muskets, although most steppe warriors carry numerous weapons (if they can) to avoid reloading in the heat of battle.

Historically, all the eastern nations had an ambiguous relationship with the steppe peoples. They both feared them and wanted their services. This allowed the more cunning steppe tribes to keep a measure of autonomy when other “natives” were being ruthlessly crushed."	false

Levying men for an army is a form of taxation-in-kind, men doing service under a variety of feudal-style laws and customs. It is enough to have a strong back; wits are not required in a levied soldier. Once taken from the field or workshop, a levy receives rudimentary training and shambles off to fight for the state. It is important to segregate him from the civilian population, particularly family and friends, hence the need for secure barracks. Once a levy has been sent to another province the risk of him running drops dramatically, of course – there’s nowhere to go. 

For many governments, a barracks is also a reminder to the population that the gun and the sabre back the edicts of the civil government in an area. 

Historically, levies were always the last in an army to receive anything, from pay, food and new weapons to accommodations. Their barracks were fetid, disgusting places, barely suitable for keeping farmyard animals, let alone large numbers of men."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_eua_hessian_grenadiers	"

Grenadiers see themselves as elite, and usually occupy the place of honour at the right of the line. They have every reason to be proud: only large, brave men become grenadiers. This size and strength makes them impressive and gives them an edge in melee combat. They are vulnerable when attacked by heavy cavalry and skirmish troops. This aside, grenadiers are dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter.

Historically, Hessian soldiers were renowned for their skills and discipline. This is due, in part, to the harsh penalties imposed upon them for any indiscipline. Corporal punishment was a regular occurrence, minor offenses often being punished with clubs and cudgels! Another popular punishment was ‘the gauntlet’: a ritualistic beating that involved a soldier’s comrades gathering in two lines to beat the accused as he ran or walked past them. For more serious offences Hessian soldiers would be swiftly hanged. This treatment did not make them tolerant of any rebellious behaviour in others, including civilians."	false

Brunswicker dragoons are versatile troops; they have a powerful charge that can break enemy infantry formations, and can ride to critical spots on the battlefield to lend support to beleaguered allies. However, should they be pitted against infantry formed in square their charge will fall short of the power achieved by heavy cavalry units. They do have the advantage of being armed with carbine muskets, but they are trained to use these when on foot; dragoons should not be expected to engage in close combat effectively when dismounted.

The Brunswicker Dragoons (and other Brunswick units) left Germany for America under the command of Col. Friedrich Riedesel in 1776. When the dragoons arrived in America they did so without horses. They were paid as heavy infantryman and acted in this capacity for many of the early campaigns. At the Battle of Bennington most of the 120 men were either killed or captured, dramatically reducing the size of the unit. Those that did survive rejoined the main body of British troops after the surrender at Saratoga. This under-strength regiment remained in garrison duty in Canada until 1783, when it returned to Brunswick."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_eua_2nd_new_york	"

Marching or line regiments make up the majority of units in European-pattern armies. They are so-called because they form the line of battle, not because they deploy in lines. They can also form square, a particularly effective tactic against cavalry charges, although this leaves the unit incredibly vulnerable to artillery fire and skirmishers. This weakness aside, the versatility of a line regiment makes them a valuable addition to any force.

The 2nd New York regiment was raised in 1775 and placed under the command of Colonel Philip van Cortlandt. The van Cortlandt family history was already impressive: Philip’s great grandfather was the first American-born mayor of New York and the family name was used for various place names across America.

Long houses are similar to wigwams, in that they use a wooden pole frame covered with elm bark. There are holes at intervals along the roof to allow smoke from the fires burning inside the building to escape. During the winter months the two main entrances are covered with animal pelts to keep out the cold winds. 

Long houses are big enough for an entire extended family or clan and have raised platform areas for sleeping mats, leaving large areas of the lower floor for socializing."	false

While these warships are among the most powerful vessels afloat, they are poor sailors, being both slow and unresponsive. This is not a serious shortcoming because, armed with around 100 cannons firing 32-, 24- and 18-pounder balls on their three decks, they can fire a terrible and destructive broadside. They carry a crew of over 800 sailors, gunners and marines and have more artillery than most land armies. Their cost, however, is a drawback and few navies can afford to build or maintain more than a handful of them.

Historically, first rates were never common, and hardly ever sent to overseas stations. They existed purely to fight in set-piece battles, and were not used for mundane duties such as protecting merchantmen, policing the seas and hunting down privateers."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_seminary_orthodox	"

Kept separate from the temptations of the world in a monastic setting, the students at a seminary are indoctrinated in matters of faith. They are given a solid, if conservative, education that will stand them in good stead when they become pillars of the community as priests: it is not their role to challenge the established order, but to minister to the people.

Historically, seminaries were also used to create a sense of national identity, particularly in Russia. History, culture and language were taught to students to give them a sense of belonging to the nation, so that they would pass this on to their flocks as well. In the late 19th Century, this nationalist and conservative education would be entirely rejected by one student. Study at the seminary at Tiflis in Georgia did not produce an obedient, respectful and compliant follower in Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili. Instead it turned him into “Koba” the bandit and gave him a taste for power and cruelty. As Stalin, he got the chance to indulge his taste."	false

Skill-at-arms is sometimes of secondary importance to such men, as is traditional military discipline. Officers are almost certainly supporters of the old regime, and should thus be banished from military service, lest they commit treachery or worse. As far as drill and tactics are concerned, fervour and loyalty to the cause are excellent substitutes. Training for battle therefore becomes little more than the ability to march forward, into any kind of hell. The revolution is a noble cause, and the worthiness of it will surely carry the men to victory after victory, no matter what the odds they face. Those who shirk in their duty of victory are disloyal!

Historically, getting rid of the officer corps in France after the Revolution was probably inevitable, but not necessarily wise. The Bourbon French army had been officered almost exclusively by noblemen and, with nobles being executed on an hourly basis, their loyalty to the new regime was doubtful. However, they did have the tactical expertise, and regaining that was to cost many lives."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_pikemen	"

Despite the fact that firepower is the key to battle, “trailing a pike” into battle is more gentlemanly than carrying a gun. Pikemen are shock troops, relying on mass and impact in melee. Pikes are not without their uses: a solid wall of spear points is a formidable barrier to any cavalry attack. Pikemen still march into battle because not every European nation can afford (or find) enough guns for everyone. Sending men into battle with an obsolescent weapon is better than sending them forward with nothing at all.

By 1700, most European generals realised that the pike and pikemen were hopelessly outdated and outclassed on a modern battlefield. Pikemen had been a vital part of all infantry formations, protecting musketeers from cavalry and being the “shock” element in melee combat. There was a fatal problem for pikemen: a musket could kill at a distance, and once a decent bayonet was developed, pikes really did lose their point!

Although a brilliant general in every (other?) respect, Maurice de Saxe, the great Marshal General of France, remained an advocate of the pike even in the 1740s. By then, it was obvious that pikes were useless against massed musket-armed infantry."	false

events_event_text_selkirk_rescued	"Following an altercation with his ship’s captain, Scotsman Alexander Selkirk found himself marooned on the island of Juan Fernando.

Originally part of a Caribbean buccaneering expedition, Selkirk’s complaints about conditions and the seaworthiness of their vessel culminated in an attempt to organise a mutiny, for which the captain unceremoniously dumped him on the archipelago to fend for himself. With only a musket, a knife, a bible, some tools for building shelter, and the clothes he stood up in, Selkirk soon regretted his actions - but by that time his ship had sailed away.

Initially staying on the beach for fear of attack by animals, Selkirk began by living in a cave and eating shellfish to survive. Each day he watched for ships that might rescue him, and gradually sank into a paranoid depression as none appeared.

He eventually abandoned his cave when mating sealions took over the beach, moving inland. Almost straight away things improved for him. His food supply became more varied, as wild goats roamed the countryside, edible roots were abundant in the soil, and there were berries from bushes also. Selkirk soon found that his natural cunning and resourcefulness served him well in his island home - rats that gnawed at him were a genuine problem until he made friends and camped with feral cats.

Using his tools to build wooden huts, Selkirk hunted goats with his musket until his gunpowder ran out, then had to learn to chase his prey and kill them with his knife alone. At one point he fell off a cliff whilst hunting, knocked himself out for a while and woke to find - instead of a broken back - that his fall had been broken by the carcass of the goat he was chasing.

In order to keep a grasp on the language he had no cause to use, Selkirk read the bible aloud. He also found it calmed his at-times-frantic emotional state. Over the course of four years only two ships sailed within rescue distance, but he hid, as they were Spanish vessels and he feared torture and death at their hands.

Finally in early February 1709 British privateers commanded by Woodes Rogers sailed into the harbour. Selkirk was overcome with joy, and having made contact set about catching goats to share with his rescuers. Rogers happily made Selkirk his mate and took him off the island."	false

Following over two years of brutally maiming and killing the local population, and a failed attempt to kill it by professional wolf hunters, local man Jean Chastel has been credited with bringing down the beast. Supposedly it appeared before him whilst he was reading the bible, and apparently Chastel finished his prayer before slaying the creature.

Whether this is true remains to be seen as the animal’s body has not been recovered. However the killings have stopped, for the time-being at least."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_elite_light_infantry_croatian_grenzers	"

These light infantry are used to harass and disrupt the enemy as battle commences. Like other skirmishing forces, the grenzers consider themselves a cut above most infantrymen. They are expected to show individual aggression, initiative and soldiering skills, not just obey and fight in formation.

Unusually, they carry heavy double-barrelled (over-and-under) muskets, allowing two shots before reloading. This innovative weapon doubles the firepower of a grenzer unit, compared to any other skirmishing force. Added to this, grenzers are taught to select their targets carefully, making them quite deadly opponents.

Historically, the Austrians had a tradition of creating high-quality light forces such as hussars and skirmishers. The grenzers were part of this tradition, recruited from among the Croat and Transylvania population of the Austrian Empire’s domains as frontier guards against the Turks. As frontiersmen, they had a certain air of lawlessness and even banditry, but they proved extremely able light troops and were used against Austria’s other enemies. Over time, however, they became a hybrid type between line infantry and skirmishers: often deployed in battle in the line, but with the ability to skirmish when necessary. As identifiable infantry units, the Grenzers remained in Austrian service until the end of the First World War in 1918."	false

A wise chief listens to his people, and uses their collective wisdom and instincts. The meeting hall gives a venue where their concerns can be heard and tribal business carried forward. The hall is also the social centre of the tribe too, where happy occasions such as marriages and births can be celebrated. 

Meeting halls were decorated with beautiful depictions of tribal history, the spirits and important animals. Some tribes also practiced sand painting, although this was used as a healing ritual. The sand images varied according to the sickness to be cured, and the beauty of the work affected the success of the healing."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tribal_playable_fur_merchant	"

Trading in fur can often be a long-winded affair until the final customer is reached, as moving furs from the wilderness relies heavily on finding river routes to transport them. The use of wooden canoes allows the furs to be sent great distances in a much shorter time than if they had been sent by land.

Historically, many European outsiders that became 'woodsmen' actually took up the native way of life, adopting their clothing, lodgings and customs. Some married native women, thus creating bonds to the tribe that came with the benefit of free and easy trade."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_improved_coppering	"

Copper sheets fitted to a wooden ship keep weeds and worms at bay, making the ship faster in the water and longer lasting in service. However, until the advent of a new alloy for making bolts to hold ship’s timbers in place, coppering caused the iron bolts to be eaten away. Although nobody understands why the iron bolts fail, experiments have revealed that an alloy of copper and zinc can make bolts of sufficient strength that are immune to the mysterious problem.

Copper sheathing for a ship is not a trivial expense, being about six times more expensive than replacing damaged timbers. For those navies who do it, however, the improved performance from not having weed-fouled hulls is well worth the expense. Fancy metallurgy is a small additional price to pay.

Historically, the alloy bolts made coppering a success, so much so that “copper bottomed” became a mark of approval: something so (financially) sound it could not possibly fail. The method remained in use until the development of anti-fouling paints; even iron hulls get fouled by weeds."	false

battles_description_battle_of_culloden	"The Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 resulted in recrimination and confusion after the invasion of England ended in retreat. By 1746 the Jacobite army of Bonnie Prince Charles was declining in numbers and motivation. Despite victories at Prestonpans and Falkirk many Highlanders had left the army after Falkirk to return home.

The British army in Scotland was now led by William, Duke of Cumberland, and second son of King George II. His army was bigger than the Jacobite force, and he had been drilling it for six weeks at Aberdeen. This training included new bayonet drills to fight the Highlanders. 

Cumberland marched north. The Jacobites chose to fight on a marsh near Culloden. This decision showed some of the internal tensions in the Jacobite army. Some thought the marshy ground would impede the famous Highland charge, a tactic which was the basis of their victory plans. The Jacobites tried a night attack on the day of Cumberland’s birthday, but it failed. In the morning, the British army, which included Highland clansmen in its ranks, assembled on the moor.

Can you change history and lead the smaller, exhausted force of Bonnie Prince Charles to victory?

Historically Culloden was won by the British government forces, with the Jacobite army being decisively defeated. This ended any hope of the Stuarts reclaiming the British throne. Cumberland gained the nickname of “Butcher” because of his orders to kill any wounded Jacobites on the field. Government loyalists called him “Sweet William”, and the flower of the same name is supposedly named in his honour."	false

events_event_text_systema_naturae	"Swedish doctor of medicine and botanist Carl Linne has published his ""Systema Naturae"", a work that outlines a system of hierarchical classification of plants, animals and minerals.

Although only a slim volume of some thirteen pages, Systema Naturae establishes Linne’s logical way of categorizing the natural world by class, order, genera and species. Though believing he is simply creating a catalogue of God's creations (and with many of the categorizations made for convenience sake rather than as an attempt to establish evolutionary relationships), the simple act of standardizing this process has brought a great degree of clarity to a complex subject.

Linne is planning regular updates to his ongoing work, undoubtedly serving to aid the thoughts and insights of like-minded men in their efforts to understand the flora and fauna of the planet."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_power_loom	"

Manual weaving is a skilled craft, one that requires long years to master and, as always, this limits the output of a craft-based industry. The power loom automates many of the movements needed to weave cloth. A cunning series of levers, cams, gears and springs make the individual elements of the loom move in precise time. The operator monitors the work, and makes sure that the machine is supplied with yarn. This unskilled labour requires nimble fingers, but not the master craftsmanship of old.

During the 18th Century powered looms were seen as a threat to many livelihoods, provoking riots and unrest when they were installed in mills. Edmund Cartwright (1743-1823) was not the first to turn his mind to mechanical weaving, but he was the first to understand the economics of the problem: that a power loom had to make more than a manual weaver, or that one operator had to be able to work several looms at the same time. His machine was not perfect, but it showed promise and the way ahead."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_earthworks_european	"

The basic concept of a star fort is that at least one, and preferably many, field of fire should cover every part of the defence and the approaches to the fort. These killing zones can be extended and made even more deadly by, at the very least, a long sloping glacis around the fort for the attackers to scale. The glacis need not be very steep at all, but the attackers face an uphill struggle with no cover at all, under murderous fire ever step of the way. The glacis also acts as a passive defence, a sloping armoured earthwork for the fort proper. Beyond the glacis a hidden counterscarp awaits: a retaining wall (sometimes with firing positions for the defenders) that drops down deep ditch that must be crossed before the actual approaches to the fort are even reached!

All of these defences are before the military architects add additional ravelins (detached triangular bastions or gun positions) in front of the fort’s own walls and hornworks and crownworks (both elaborations on the basic bastion design). The whole effect, when viewed in plan form, is baroque in its complexity, each projection of the central star giving the defence another firing position towards any attacking force. Wall length is limited to that which can be covered by flanking musket fire, as experience showed that a fort with only cannons in its defence could be taken when the cannons were knocked out."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_usa_independence_hall	"

 Independence Hall in Philadelphia was actually built by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature as their State House, and so for the first two decades after completion it was home to part of the British administration in America. It is a practical, red brick building in a grand colonial style and has an architectural honesty and pleasing, human proportion to it that is sometimes lacking in grander neo-Classical structures.

From 1775, the building was the home to the Second Continental Congress, the representatives of the Thirteen Colonies who approved the Declaration of Independence. The romantic view is that the “Liberty Bell” was rung to bring citizens to hear the reading of the Declaration in July 1776. Unfortunately, for romantics, historians now believe that the steeple of Independence Hall was in too bad a state to allow the ringing of any bells from the Hall. That hasn’t stopped the romantics believing the story for a minute! Independence Hall was abandoned by Congress when the British occupied Philadelphia from 1777-78. The government eventually moved to a specially created federal district (later to become Washington DC) when a mutiny by the Continental Army drove them out of Philadelphia in 1783. But for the actions of the mutineers, Philadelphia would probably still be the capital of the United States."	false

The Marines are light infantry, line infantry and sea-going soldiers: whatever is required to carry out their appointed task, they will turn their hands to it. Every Marine prides himself on being a fighting soldier first and foremost especially if he is an officer. This battle-winning spirit is a powerful weapon in the Marine arsenal, and these men will rarely, if ever, run from a fight.

Traditionally, the US Marines claim to date back to 1775, and the establishment of the Continental Marines during the Revolution. These forces were disbanded when America won its independence, and the Congress was forced to raise new forces of a United States Navy and a Marines Corps in 1798 when war with Revolutionary France looked likely. The units were raised with such haste that they were given hand-me-down infantry uniforms, including the uncomfortable stocks that give the Marines their “Leathernecks” nickname. That war never came, but the Marines were in action within a short pace of time, proving their worth in fights against the Barbary Pirates. Marine officers wearing full dress uniform still carry a “Mameluke” pattern sword to commemorate these early successes."	false

Naturally, locals claim the invention for themselves, describing how a clockmaster named Franz Anton Ketterer from Schönwald was inspired by the bellows of a church organ, incorporating a miniature version puffing air into the pipes to mark each hour.

Whether they are right or not the craftsmen of the Black Forest have contributed much to the artistry of these popular time-pieces - adorning clock faces with painted scenes, and carving the weights that power the mechanism into the shapes of pine cones."	false

Long houses are similar to wigwams, in that they use a wooden pole frame covered with elm bark. There are holes at intervals along the roof to allow smoke from the fires burning inside the building to escape. During the winter months the two main entrances are covered with animal pelts to keep out the cold winds. 

Long houses are big enough for an entire extended family or clan and have raised platform areas for sleeping mats, leaving large areas of the lower floor for socializing."	false

In restricted waters galleys are useful craft, although in any kind of heavy sea they can be dangerous to manage: it would be a brave or foolish captain who risked his galley in the North Sea or Atlantic. Although they do not carry as many guns as a modern sailing vessel, the ability to move independently of the wind is very useful.

The fighting crew of a galley is a relatively small part of the full crew, because the rowers are often convicts or pressed men and aboard only as strong backs, not as stout hearts. Indeed, in some navies the rowers are often more of a threat to the crew than the enemy! The number of men carried also limits the strategic range of a galley: they simply cannot carry enough food and water to sustain the crew for longer than a few days.

Historically, galleys did good service in sheltered waters like the Mediterranean and the Baltic, and the Ottomans, Russians and Swedes all used them in anger. They were also favoured by the Barbary Coast pirates, who could be guaranteed a good supply of slave rowers from captured European merchantmen."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_garde_du_corp	"

A court regiment, the Garde du Corps are part of the monarch’s personal household, but they are a useful force for any general. As part of a tactical reserve, they can attack wavering enemies, delivering the blow that drives them from the field. They should not be used for pursuit, a task better suited to lighter cavalry. Only a rash or extremely bold general would have them attack a prepared enemy: cavalry are usually not capable of breaking infantry formations without support.

Given the informal nature of many armies in the 18th Century, household troops were the only ones a monarch could rely upon in a crisis. The Garde du Corps of the Netherlands was a conscious attempt to copy the French Bourbon household troops, widely regarded as being the best in Europe. The French were often seen as military geniuses, from siege warfare and tactics to military fashion. It was far from outrageous for other crowned heads to ape the French Garde du Corps when looking to their own security."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_native_american_musketeers	"

A musket is a status symbol among the tribes, even though it is not as practical or reliable as a hunting bow. A musket does, however, have a greater killing power and range than a bow. Warrior tactics in battle closely resemble those of European skirmishers, moving as small groups and firing as individuals. Massed volleys are almost unknown.

Historically, the tribes used whatever smoothbore muskets they could obtain by trade, theft or conquest. It was highly unlikely that any two guns would bear more than a passing similarity, unless the tribe had managed to ambush and defeat a European military unit."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_drill_school_european	"

In an age when all battlefield manoeuvres must be performed exactly, drill is a necessary part of all military training. Constant repetition of the actions involved in loading and firing a piece are useful in themselves, but of more use is the unthinking obedience to superiors that is, literally, drilled into every man in the ranks. When a soldier is concentrating on his place in line and on not attracting the attention of his sergeant or officer, he will not worry about what the enemy might be doing. Drill has another benefit for an army too: men busy on the parade ground cannot be getting into trouble or finding a tavern!

In Britain, one aspect of 18th Century drill survives to this day in the form of a ceremonial parade called “Trooping the Colour”, carried out on the monarch’s official birthday on Horse Guards, in London. Originally, this parade was not a celebration but a practical exercise: the men needed to know what “the colours”, or flags, of their unit looked like. The fact that the monarch gets to review the soldiers is not the point! In battle, the men would need to be able to rally to, and then defend, these colours on command."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_poland_akademia	"

Historically, the Akademia, or Szkoła Rycerska, was the Knights’ School or the Nobles’ Academy of Cadets. It was the first state school in Poland, established by King Stanislaw August Poniatowski, the last elected monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1765. King Stanislaw had an abiding belief in the worth of education, both to the individual and the state. Surrounded by enemies, he did his best to advance Polish interests.

One of the more interesting officer cadets was Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746-1817). Benjamin Franklin recruited him to serve in the Continental Army, and he was appointed as head (military) engineer. His contributions at Ticonderoga and Saratoga, among other occasions, eventually lead to his promotion to brigadier general. He was also given citizenship, land and a large cash grant. To his eternal credit, he used his reward money to help black slaves achieve their freedom. Not satisfied with that, he returned home to Poland and organised a rising against the occupying Russians, although this ended in failure. Tsar Paul I, however, obviously thought him important and influential: in return for an oath of loyalty, 20,000 Polish prisoners of war were freed. Before his death in exile in 1815, Kościuszko had also freed all his serfs in Poland."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_minor_governors_encampment	"

While having soldiers to hand is clearly useful, it is equally important to keep them away from civilians except in an official capacity. By keeping the men in an encampment rather than quartering them in people’s homes they can be kept from fraternizing too much with the locals. They have no chance to develop any unfortunate sympathies that will keep them from enforcing the governor’s orders without hesitation. It is, of course, impossible to keep soldiers away from all their comforts, but contacts can be limited.

Historically, most “encampments” were hardly military in appearance, as most armies needed a huge baggage train of sutlers to provide food and drink, wagon masters for transport, armourers and smiths for weapons and gear, pioneers, priests, hangers-on, hawkers, officers’ servants, and a raggle-taggle of dependents, not to mention wives of both the permanent and just-for-an-hour-or-two kind."	false

Many visitors have whiled away the long cold Prussian evenings by contemplating the possibility of a walking tour of the city, starting and ending in the same location and crossing each bridge only once. Celebrated mathematician, physicist and all round spoil-sport Leonhard Euler has typically spoiled everyone's fun by solving the problem.

Disappointingly, it seems that it is not possible to complete the circuit - but it is the method by which Herr Euler has proved this that has proved exciting to the numerate community. The reduction of the problem to a set of nodes and connecting arcs is seen as the genesis of ""graph theory""."	false

The fate of the Grand Alliance against Bourbon France hung in the balance. If the French forces reached Vienna, the Alliance would probably have collapsed.

While lying to his allies about his plans, British General John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough and ancestor of Winston Churchill, marched his army down the Danube, using brilliant administration to make sure his men were properly fed and supplied all the way. He managed to catch a numerically-superior Franco-Bavarian army before they could reach Vienna and forced a battle.

Tallard's French forces had to defeat Churchill’s allied force in order to reach Vienna. They could not hope to lay siege to the city with an Allied army behind them. The fate of the Grand Alliance hung in the balance."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_abolition_of_slavery	"

The slave trade is hugely profitable for those who engage in it, whether through trade such as that from Africa to the New World, or conquest such as the depredations of European shipping by the Barbary Pirates of North Africa. The morality and necessity of slave owning, however, are disputed. Abolition of the trade has its roots in religious feelings and in radical Enlightenment thought, but its effects are clear: a cessation of slave taking, transportation and exploitation.

Historically, abolition was far from universally popular. William Wilberforce (1759-1833), the MP for Kingston-upon-Hull in Yorkshire, campaigned for many years in the face of bitter opposition from mercantile interests. His eventual success only outlawed slavery in British possessions and British involvement in any foreign trade. The Royal Navy acted as a “world policeman”, attempting to stop the African trade at source. Oddly, English judges had already decided that slaves could become free by stepping onto English soil in 1772. Wilberforce’s work was the start of a process that continues even today with attempts to stop “people trafficking”."	false

The entire process is still subject to the vagaries of weather, soil and time. It is quite possible for an estate to produce a truly great wine one year and a foul one the next because, while standards are improving, there are still a great many variables that are only dimly understood. 

In some parts of the world, a great wine estate is a prestigious possession, over and above its economic value. 

And the value could be great indeed: the 18th Century was a time of prodigious boozing in Europe. Georgian Englishmen, for example, apparently had bottomless gullets even by contemporary standards, as the available water was not always fit to drink. Contrary to the popular belief of the time, excessive drinking was not the cause of gout (an agonising inflammation of the joints) only a contributory factor. Gout is triggered by a high-protein diet (as favoured by the wealthier classes of the period), and the liberal use of toxic lead compounds to sweeten wine probably did little to help matters!"	false

Against him was a similarly large British fleet led by Admiral Sir George Rodney, a very successful commander with several victories to his name. Aware of likely French and Spanish plans, Rodney tailed de Grasse from the moment he left the anchorage at Martinique.

There was a small engagement, but no major battle resulted. The British continued to follow the French. De Grasse tried to divert Rodney so that he could rendezvous with the Spanish, but unfortunately collisions between his ships allowed the British to close on the French.

Take control of the British fleet and see if you can recreate Rodney’s victory at the Saintes. Historically, the gaps opened up in French fleet during the fight allowing the British fleet to break their line and win a decisive victory. This frustrated any French and Spanish hopes of taking Jamaica."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_native_american_tribesmen	"

When the tribe is threatened all men are called to arms. Young or old matters little as long as they have the strength and will to hold a weapon. Some men may have never seen battle, and only have weapons used in the hunt. Pride in protecting the tribe and the possible spoils that come from distinguishing oneself in battle are enough to drive tribesmen forward.

Historically, tattoos commemorated the brave actions of a tribesman. Fish bones or rock splinters were used to cut the design, and soot or natural dyes coloured the wound. If one tribe defeated another in battle all those on the winning side were given tattoos to commemorate the victory. Animal totems were another popular theme, giving the wearer the strength of the creature in the tattoo design."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_army_staff_college_european	"

Tactics may win battles, but wars are won thanks to information, strategy and, above all, supply. An army that is unfed and lost is no use to anyone. An army staff college produces officers with the skills needed to deal with the many details involved in keeping an army in the field. Apart from an understanding of strategy, officers are taught military illustration (the vital skill of producing accurate sketch maps and diagrams), some surveying, military law, how to behave like a proper gentleman (regrettably necessary in some cases), horsemanship, weapons handling and given character-building instruction. The end product is a man who can be an aide to a general in all situations.

Historically, the British, for example, had an inherent distrust of armies as tools of tyranny, and this may have contributed to the low priority given to raising professional standards. Pupils had to fund their studies from their own pockets at the Royal Military College! This had an additional advantage, of course, in ensuring that only candidates from the “right” social classes could afford to attend. Other nations were not so suspicious of giving soldiers necessary military skills."	false

events_event_text_first_restaurant_paris	"Paris, generally acknowledged as a leading city for European fashion and taste, has seen the opening of a new kind of eating establishment, the popularity of which may be setting a new trend that may yet equal the alehouse and inn in terms of popularity.

Soup maker Monsieur Boulanger’s eatery is known as a ""restaurant"", after the restorative soup of the same name. It differs from more traditional eating establishments in that it is intended to cater not only for travellers, but also to local residents who leave their homes to ""eat out"". As others draw inspiration from Boulanger’s basic premise, further innovations are occurring. Already customers can sit at separate tables - rather than finding a seat at a shared table - and a variety of dishes can be ordered from a set list rather than a single dish served from a large common pot.

These new restaurants are changing public perceptions of eating outside of the home from being something done for the sake of expediency when travelling, to being a pleasurable pastime in its own right."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_free_trade_doctrine	"

Free trade is an intensely pleasing prospect for traders. The basic principle is that the less those in power involve themselves in matters of trade the more it will be able to flourish and grow, thus creating wealth. Taxes, tariffs or other restrictions that can be laid upon trade will only prove counterproductive. This runs entirely counter to the medieval idea of guilds, that sought to limit trade and production of goods to those who had spent years learning their craft.

Historically, David Ricardo (1772-1823) was one of the leading minds in the advancement of the free trade doctrine. He sought to prove that it could be beneficial not only to the economically strong, but also to the economically weak. He developed this theory and it became known as the theory of “Comparative Advantage.” The key point of the theory was the idea that a region or a country should specialise in goods that are easily and economically made within their borders. By doing this, a sizeable yet easy profit would result and grow from trade with others"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sheep_tenanted_farms_european	"

Tenanted farms primarily produce cash crops. The landlord expects his rent to be paid, so subsistence farming is a waste of time, as it will not generate any income. Successful tenants, who develop the land, can become quietly wealthy men and may be able to buy their farms. 

For a landlord the main benefit of tenanted farms is that income from them is in cash, not kind. Absentee landlords can therefore live the high life in a city; they rarely need trouble themselves with the mud and muck of the countryside – as long as they have trustworthy agents and tenants! A leisured class of “gentlemen farmers” and rentiers therefore arises, all thanks to the efforts of tenant farmers.

Historically, tenanted farms made good profit but, like all farming, were subject to the vagaries of the weather. Tenancies could be, and were, passed down the generations of families, something that allow tenants to see a point in developing “their” land with their cash surplus."	false

The Hofburg was the imperial residence of the Hapsburgs in Vienna, with sections dating back to the Middle Ages. The idea of this being a single palace is something of a mistake, as it is a complex of buildings that has grown up over the centuries as the needs (not to mention rivalries and dislikes) of the Hapsburg rulers have changed. It housed chapels, a music school, and numerous smaller residences for cadet branches of the family. Indeed, there is a complete second palace in the Imperial Stables, a result of a falling out between the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and his son, the Crown Prince Maximilian. Relations between the two were so bad that the Emperor did not want his son under the same roof!

Over the centuries the Hofburg has been extensively rebuilt and remodelled as funds have been available and tastes have changed. It remains, however, a serious expression of Imperial power and grandeur. The building is still in use today as the official residence of the Austrian president."	false

They are also largely unschooled in modern tactics and fight as heroic individuals rather than an organised military force. They have little to lose and much to gain by “taking up the sword”: freedom from the threat of slavery, for a start. Because of this heroic style of fighting, the loss of only a few prominent individuals can throw the whole unit into disarray.

Historically, freed slaves were used as militias and defensive forces in the New World from time to time. Plantation owners in the Caribbean were understandably reluctant to arm any Africans for fear of revenge being taken. Servile insurrections were a terrible threat, given the appalling conditions that were visited upon the slave population. During the American War of Independence the British offered freedom to any Africans who came over to their side, but these promises proved to be of little worth when the war ended. The freedmen were dumped in singularly harsh and unattractive corners of the remaining British possessions, and left to shift for themselves without much further support."	false

John Smith is a fearless leader.

Armed with arquebuses and a desire to colonise the New World, these men will have to fight to make a home for themselves in an inhospitable land. 

Historically, John Smith was a bit of a rogue. During the voyage to the New World, he incited mutiny and was locked in the brig, pending trial upon arrival. The ship’s captain - Christopher Newport - intended to have Smith executed, but, thanks to orders issued by the Virginia Company before the voyage had even begun, Smith was reprieved. He was named as one of the leaders of the early colony, and as such Newport felt compelled to let him live."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_puckle_gun	"

It achieves this by using pre-loaded breech chambers that are rotated into line with the barrel, fired and then a new chamber is positioned for the next shot. All this is achieved mechanically, by the operator revolving a handle at the back of the piece. As long as loaded magazines are available for the piece, a puckle gun can be kept in rapid fire action!

Historically, James Puckle’s “defence gun” was not a huge success, partly because the engineering of 1718 simply wasn't up to the task of producing components with fine tolerances. His gun had promise, though, as it could fire shots around three times faster than a well-trained fusilier. One odd feature of the design was the two versions offered to potential customers: a round barrel fired conventional bullets for shooting at Christian (but not Protestant) enemies, while a second barrel was offered that fired square bullets (that allegedly did more damage) for use against Turks and similar unwelcome infidels. The British Royal Navy never bought any, and other users were equally reluctant to part with their money. Puckle’s career as a gunsmith ended in failure for him and his investors."	false

Enclosure laws remove the rights of the lower social classes to graze their animals on common land, because it is now legally someone’s private property, and fenced in as such. Farming does become more efficient as a result because subsistence farming is replaced by cash crops, and there is more food grown. This is of little consequence to the common people who have been dispossessed of their ancient rights. They cannot feed themselves anymore from their own smallholdings and herds which grazed on the commons, and must take the wages offered by the new landlords.

In England the landowners sitting in Parliament were not backwards in passing many “Inclosure” Acts for their own benefit in the 18th Century. Enormous parcels of land were, effectively, stolen from the common working people and incorporated into private estates. The effect was to empty the landscape of unwanted labourers, who were forced into the new mill towns and rapidly industrialising cities, swapping rural poverty for urban squalor. Poor laws did little to alleviate poverty, other than making sure that the poor moved on to starve somewhere else."	false

The dancers draw on Hindu temple traditions, but their dances are secular. All styles of dance can fall into the category of Nautch, but the dancers are always well-presented and graceful girls. Indeed, a career as a Nautch girl can be a way for a girl to work her way out of poverty or a low social caste. Good performers can find work in the courts of rulers from nawabs to zamindars, and their presence adds considerable lustre to any formal event. Muslim rulers also employ Nautch dancers to entertain their guests.

Historically, Nautch dancing rose to prominence under the Mughal emperors but they continued to be popular, even when the British East India Company took over much of the administration of the Indian sub-continent."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_superior_line_infantry	"

These men are a cut above the average line infantry regiment and they are often the lynchpin of a commander’s battle strategy. The presence of such men in the line of battle is enough to lift the hearts of all those around them, strengthening their determination to resist any enemy. A general can be confident that these men will hold, and he can base the rest of his strategy around that fact.

The factors which lead a regiment to acquire an exalted position within its country’s military are hard to define: training and skill play their part, but in the main it is physical and mental endurance that keeps good men fighting even when the tide of battle is against them. A lucky few carry such strength within themselves, but others derive it from the proud martial traditions of their regiment. In Europe, the famous ‘vieux’ and ‘petits-vieux’ regiments of France have centuries of such history to call upon, whilst the various deeds of the British Coldstream Guards and Black Watch regiments reinforce the natural grit of the men in their ranks."	false

battles_description_battle_of_fontenoy	"The War of the Austrian Succession had its roots in the ancient Salic law that said no woman could inherit the Holy Roman Empire. Despite this, Maria Theresa succeeded to most of her father's possessions, and there was an understanding among many German princes that her husband could be elected Emperor. Frederick II of Prussia, however, used the dispute to invade Silesia in 1740 to enhance Prussian power and prestige.

The war quickly became a European affair as old enmities surfaced once again. The French, naturally, opposed the Austrian Hapsburgs.

In 1745, at Fontenoy in the Austrian Netherlands, a French army under the redoubtable Marshal de Saxe, clashed with a Anglo-Dutch-Hanoverian force. The battle was an extremely bloody one, with eventually the French left holding the field against a massed infantry assault by the British and their allies.

The British defeat encouraged the French to stir up rebellion in Scotland, leading directly to the landing of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite rising of ""the '45""."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_hussars	"

These superb horsemen are a force that can be used as a screen by the main army, or for strategic scouting to locate the enemy. They are armed with curved sabres and smoothbore carbine muskets. Their gaudy, almost popinjay uniforms should not lead enemies to underestimate them as mere dandies – these are trained, disciplined and dangerous soldiers. 

Hussars have a certain swashbuckling attitude towards the business of warfare, and the bandit origins of the Hungarian “huszárok” are certainly evident. Even non-Hungarian hussars cultivate a slightly barbarous air, and little private or enemy property is safe when they are around! Oddly, they are also unusually democratic, and troopers expect to be consulted by their officers before attacking the enemy, again probably a legacy of their brigand heritage. 

Historically, many nations adopted hussars after the Austrian type proved successful, and military fashions were also influenced by the hussars’ splendid and elaborate uniforms. Hussar uniforms became slight caricatures, but remained very fashionable and popular, particularly with ladies – perhaps it was the very tight breeches that were so appealing."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_cotton_gin	"

A cotton “gin” (engine) separates cotton fibres from the seed pod, a delicate and tedious activity if done by hand. It is also a slow one, and thus expensive. The gin uses rotating wooden cylinder covered in small metal teeth attached to pull raw cotton through a grate. The holes are too small for the seeds, but allow the fibres through. Labourers are still needed to feed cotton into the machine and collect the sorted fibres.
Eli Whitney, the American-born inventor of the cotton gin, used his textile experience to make the first machine while working as a tutor in Savannah, Georgia. He not only revolutionised cotton production, but profoundly influenced American patent laws. His legal battles – fought tooth and nail – against other inventors who “borrowed” his ideas set a pattern that is still followed today. Creativity, inventions, patents and the royalties to be earned from them are the building blocks of modern high-technology companies."	false

No one can afford to ignore a plentiful food supply, even if gathering it means braving the ocean swell. Sea fishery is a risky undertaking, but one that can feed many. The spearing skills and equipment used by each man are the same as for freshwater fish. Once taken, fish can be smoked or salted to last the long winter months.

Historically the North American tribes did not really have the sailing technology to exploit the vast stocks of sea fish that were to be found off the coast. However, given that the potential of this food source was demonstrated by the Europeans, it is likely they would have exploited it given the chance."	false

A wide variety of burial customs are observed. Some believe that the air is important to the passing of their loved ones. Thus wooden scaffolds are created and the dead placed on top, so their spirit may pass into the wind. Others believe the spirit must be kept with the body after death and thus build ‘spirit houses’ to trap the spirit. These little wooden structures can take many forms, some even look like miniature houses standing over the body.

Burial rites are often closely tied to tribal totems: eagle-related tribes, for example,  always place their dead on scaffolding. A bear totem tribe often buries the dead in wooded areas, and so on."	false

A Chief’s lodge is not only home to the man’s whole family, and one family could live in the lodge for many years as the position was passed down from father to son. The chief presides over many matters, and is expected to give every one his best attention.

In some tribes a chief’s standing was denoted by the length and number of feathers in his ‘war bonnet.’ These were earned for acts of bravery on behalf of the tribe. Eagle feathers had a deep symbolism attached to them and if a chief had any he was a great man indeed!"	false

Extracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.

It is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it."	false

A musket is a status symbol among the tribes, even though it is not as useful in a fight as an old-fashioned and reliable bow. It is, however, a mark of personal bravery that a warrior has taken one in battle, or been considered worthy enough to have been given one of the precious weapons. These men are the most irregular of forces, unwilling to take formal army discipline, yet willing to fight like men possessed when the need arises.

In the early days of European settlement, the Native Americans were happy to work with the various foreign powers that colonized America, even forming alliances against their neighbours and other Europeans. The tribes soon became involved in trade, fought wars because of the allegiances they forged, and were forced into new alliances as old tribal enemies took up with Europeans."	false

The Smithsonian is not like other major museums, established to show off the collections of wealthy patrons or as an exercise in national glory. Instead, it is the legacy of a man who was neither an American nor visited the country. James Smithson (1765–1829) stipulated that his fortune was to be used for the “increase & diffusion of Knowledge among men” if his nephew died without leaving an heir. With over pre-inflationary $500,000 in the fund, it took Congress nearly a decade to decide how to spend the money and the Smithsonian “Castle” in Washington was only completed in 1855.

Since then, the Smithsonian has become one of the world’s leading repositories for historical objects and archives, funded by the US government and private donations. It now has 20 different branches, specialising in everything from ethnic art and objects to aerospace exhibits, and helping to manage the Smithsonian is one of the (very few) official duties of the Vice President of the United States."	false

Hunting is a way of life, and the methods and techniques used have been handed down for generations. The seasons play a huge role in the way hunting parties operate:. in autumn when the grasses are dry, fire is used in hunting. Once a herd of animals is located a large arc of fire is started while, the hunters pick the animals as they run from the flames.

The re-introduction of the horse into the Americas meant the tribes could hunt over a greater range for extended periods of time. On the Great Plains, some young braves would pursue buffalo for months on end."	false

Trade in furs is highly profitable, as almost any item can be parleyed into a good deal for pelts. Shipping furs back to home markets can be more of a problem, as transport in the wilderness relies heavily on finding navigable river routes.

By 1700 the Hudson Bay Company was well established and expanding its operations into previously French-dominated territories. It had been set up in 1670, in London, by a royal charter to trade with the natives of Canada. The company traded English wool blankets to the native tribes in return for beaver pelts, and became the de facto colonial British government in Canada. Some of its trading posts became the sites of substantial fortifications. In this, it matched the East India Company’s success in the East. It did much better than the EIC in surviving to the present day; then again, the EIC had a spectacular lack of success in persuading Mughal India to take heavy woollen blankets as trade goods!"	false

Completing a challenge first set out a quarter of a century before by the scientist Horace-Benedict Saussure, Paccard planned the expedition in detail for three years. Intending to gather accurate information about the true height of the peak, he studied the grand plateau of the mountain with binoculars in order to gather information on weather patterns, and the likelihood of avalanches occurring.

After recruiting Balmat and following a hazardous climb of almost three days, they finally reached the summit. Once there, Paccard was unable to gather the information he wanted due to damage to his barometer. Unable to find shelter and snowblind, he was led back down to their bivouac by Balmat, returning safely to the valley the following afternoon."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_vineyards_european	"

Wine is one of the pleasures of life for all classes in society and, along with ale, is the standard drink of many Europeans thanks to poor quality water supplies in towns and cities. No one actually cares about the public health implications of wells and open sewers in close proximity to each other!

The patterns of growth and consumption of wine in the 18th Century often had some odd roots. The British taste for “claret” (Bordeaux wine) dates back to the Middle Ages when the English monarchy controlled the region. Much of the earliest “New World” wine is supposedly the result of plantings by the Catholic Church to ensure that they had a supply of wine for Mass. Grape varieties can have similar odd origins: Shiraz, for example, started as Syrah grapes, originating in Persia and were brought back to France around the time of the Crusades. There were many more local grape varieties than today, because pests from America wiped out older types in the 19th Century."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_joint_stock_companies	"

Joint stock companies are developed by financiers who, as part of their ownership, become shareholders. They are then given stocks that they can sell at any time, preferably for a profit. Coffee houses are popular haunts for men looking to trade in stocks. Many coffee house owners even keep a record of the prices of stocks and commodities, encouraging these new financiers to conduct their affairs within their establishments – all the while indulging in expensive and fashionable coffee drinking!

Historically, the South Sea Company was one of the more notorious joint stock companies. Robert Harley, the British Treasurer, set it up but, although the company appeared to be interested in trade, its chief purpose was to fund government debt incurred during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). Rampant speculation pushed share prices to insane levels and, in the inevitable crash, many lost their entire fortunes."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_walloon_guards	"

Although a court regiment and expected to be immaculate at all times, they are also capable field soldiers. Trained to fight in line of battle, they are far steadier under fire than any ordinary infantry and equally capable in close-quarters fighting too.

Historically, this bodyguard unit was originally raised in mostly Catholic Wallonia (now part of Belgium), a Hapsburg, and therefore Spanish, possession at the time. As with other royal families, it was considered safer to have outsiders as guards for the monarch rather than locals, who might put their local sympathies ahead of royal safety in times of crisis. The loss of the Spanish Netherlands meant that non-Walloons had to be accepted into their ranks, although the name and the tradition of loyalty to the crown were retained. The first intake of Walloons had all been big men, to act as shock troops, but by the middle of the 18th Century they had been remodelled as a royal guard, consciously aping the French Bourbon Swiss Guards to add dignity to the Spanish court, by then under another branch of the Bourbon family."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_coaching_inn_european	"

A coach or post-chaise is the only practical and vaguely civilized method of getting from A to B overland, other than hiring a horse. Regular runs exist between many major towns, run on a commercial basis by private companies, necessitating a series of coaching inns roughly a day’s travel apart where passengers can rest overnight. Horses must also be changed at regular intervals if speed is to be maintained. Coach journeys of any length demand epic levels of stamina from passengers, hence the need for good inns. The condition of most roads is execrable, the suspension on most coaches is somewhat lacking, the schedule is punishing and the risk of robbery by “gentlemen of the road” should not be underestimated. 

The locals, of course, also drink and eat at a coaching inn, and a good one will have a high reputation for its cellar and its provender. The usual selection of “entertainment” for gentlemen travellers is available, always at the right price!  

The word coach, by the way, comes from the Hungarian “Kocsi szekér” meaning “wagon of Kocs”, the place where the first coach was produced."	false

She is easily the equal of many smaller fourth rate ships of the line in terms of combat power as she carries 44 24-pounder guns; a normal frigate in another navy would carry 12-pounders at best. The Constitution is also strongly built and large, allowing her to withstand punishment from other frigates and still be able to outrun larger opposition.

Unlikely as it sounds, the United States sold off the ships of the Continental Navy after the Revolutionary War. This had unfortunate consequences because the Barbary pirates noticed that, if America was a new nation, American ships were no longer protected by any treaty signed with Britain. The USS Constitution was therefore intended to combat the pirates. Even more incredibly, once a treaty with the pirates had been signed, construction was suspended! Eventually, Congress agreed to fund the ship, and she was launched in 1797.

In 1801 the Constitution was used as a flagship during the First Barbary War, but her most famous action was in fighting the Royal Navy’s HMS Guerriere (captured from the French in 1806) during the War of 1812. During the vicious close-in battle, British shot bounced off the thick planking of the Constitution, giving rise to her nickname “Old Ironsides”."	false

The life of a warrior is one of blood and filth in battle; more than that, from time to time the soul needs cleansing too. Though similar to a sauna in that it is a hot confined space, the sweat lodge is a spiritual place rather than somewhere for rest and relaxation. The intense heat purifies and focuses meditation, opening up the paths to new sacred knowledge.

The sweat lodge was traditional to almost all the native tribes but each had their own version. In the northeast, the frames of the lodge were made of willow and covered in birch bark or animal skins; in the southeast the lodges were earth mounds or built into a hillside. The Plains tribes covered their sweat lodges in buffalo hides; even the Inuit tribes of the far north used sweat lodges. However, as European missionaries sought to convert tribesman to Christianity they saw the sweat lodge and its use as a spiritual gateway as a threat. They were often banned on reservations."	false

The investigation of the universe, and disputation over the results, are not done out of any sense of altruism, of course. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the work undertaken. Personal pride and ambition are also stern taskmasters. But what is significant is that the ideas, theories and facts generated at the university are not kept within the academic elite. This flowering of learning informs and inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen too. The practical benefits of the advances made here percolate out into the wider national society, improving life for the ordinary people in ways both small and dramatic.

In the 18th Century great universities and the great minds they attracted were sources of nationalistic pride. Sir Isaac Newton was lauded across Europe for his work at Cambridge in England. The University of Gottingen aided the development of “German-ness” by publishing research and standard texts in German as well as Latin (the traditional language of learning). Gottingen was also unusual in, rather daringly, letting lecturers teach any book without reference to the State or Church!"	false

The monarch acts within the law and with the consent of the governed in a constitutional monarchy. This is what distinguishes the system from the crude absolutism of rule by the sovereign’s whims and foibles: laws limit what the Crown can do, what taxes can be levied, and how the people can be treated. In such a system, it is wise for the people to be consulted, and to be seen to be consulted, even if the sovereign’s appointed governors actually make the decisions. Often, executive power is handed down to a local council of worthies: men wealthy and well connected enough to have a stake in the survival of the state. They can be trusted to act loyally, in the best interests of the monarch, themselves and the people.

Historically, appointed governors often took it upon themselves to select local men to advise them about local matters. For example, there was a tradition in English colonies overseas for landowners to offer their services and best advice to the London-appointed governors, whether it was welcome or not!"	false

Though prematurely abandoned by many European armies, the lance remains a formidable weapon when used at the charge, concentrating the weight of horse and rider into a single needle-sharp point. The lance has retained its popularity in India, a centre of excellence with the weapon.

The term ‘sipahi’ has its roots in ancient Persian where it means simply ‘army’. In common with cavalry formations the world over, sipahis have an air of high status and their elaborate arms, mounts and armour underline the fact that they are not mere foot-sloggers. A general who can call on their knows that once battle is joined, the shock of their charge, skilfully applied, can swiftly destroy all but the most resolute and disciplined enemy."	false

With a model sun at its centre, and the planets arrayed around it on metal rods, the machine is powered by a characteristically accurate clockwork mechanism.

Copies of this fascinating and beautiful machine are being produced for several persons of high status, including the Earl of Orrery - under whose patronage the project was undertaken, and in whose honour the apparatus has been named. Whereas the ancient Greeks are said to have modelled the known planets and their motions, Graham's Orrery is the first example of such a device from our modern age, including many planets of which the ancients were unaware.

The Orrery is all the more admirable in that the skill and complexity of its construction mirrors, in some small way, the infinite intricacies of the heavens, and yet serves to present these difficult concepts in a fashion readily apparent to those without an enquiring mind when it comes to matters of science."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_citizenship	"

A man must be accountable for his own actions, for if he is not, is he a man at all? When actions are considered in the context of others, men begin along the path of citizenship. With the status of citizen there are responsibilities that are inherent in this position. In order to gain the advantages and privileges of being a citizen, a man must adhere to the rules laid out by those that have made him thus.

The idea of citizenship hails from Classical antiquity, and in particular the study of Roman authors and their views upon Roman Republican politics. Certain members of society were given “citizenship”, in effect creating a ruling class with greater political and social rights than their fellow nationals. Slaves and foreigners were not to be given political rights, and any social rights they had were limited at best. This “Roman” idea of citizenship did not imply any move to democracy of any kind, but it did imply a commonality of interests among the citizenry"	false

Extracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.

It is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it."	false

Built on the Strand, Somerset House was in a neo-classical style, and was not unusual in having its own water gates and docks in the basement. Eighteenth Century roads were fairly appalling, so the River Thames was the main highway through London and well frequented by government officials. The Thames was also the main sewer for London, which may have made it difficult for casual onlookers to distinguish between politicians and lumps of dung.

When Somerset House was designed, it was intended to be a home for most of the government, at least according to the Act of Parliament in 1775 that enabled the work. Among other departments, space was to be available for the Salt Office, the Stamp Office, the Tax Office, the Navy Office (later the Admiralty), the Navy Victualling Office, the Publick Lottery Office, the Hawkers and Pedlar Office, the Hackney Coach Office, the Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, the Auditors of the Imprest Office, the Pipe Office, the Offices of the Duchies of Lancaster and of Cornwall, the Office of the Ordinance, the Bargemaster’s House, and the King’s Barge Houses. Over the next decades, additional building work allowed the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquities to find rooms, not to mention the University of London as some government tenants either moved out or were closed down."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_university_european	"

Education is vital for those who wish to enter the professions, or make their way in government using talent alone. A good, well-trained brain is an excellent substitute for birth and social connections. A young gentleman’s studies can be wide ranging, and need not be tied to any particular faculty or subject area – an awarded degree or doctorate is proof enough of intellectual achievement.

Historically, in Europe at least, the established church controlled most universities, either through paying for them or by laws requiring the tutors to take holy orders. Sir Isaac Newton was very unusual in that he didn’t take orders when he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge (a post currently held by Stephen Hawking), arguing that the post required the holder to spend time on science, not the Anglican Church. However, the requirement for teachers to accept Church doctrine did mean that universities had a socially conservative outlook. While scholarships were available, students had to have money to attend, reinforcing this conservatism. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it worked did emerge from universities, the institutions were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds."	false

events_event_text_vampire_attack_serbia	"Following reports from across the empire regarding the spread of so-called vampirism, Regimental Field Surgeon to the Emperor, Johannes Fluckinger, has been assigned to investigate the situation.

Thirty days after he fell from a hay wagon and broke his neck, Arnold Paole was bothering the local populace in the village where he once resided. Paole sometimes told that he was haunted by a vampire and cured by smearing himself with the vampire’s blood and earth from its grave.

After forty days in the grave, a further four deaths were attributed to his undead intervention, so Paole’s body was exhumed by order of the authorities and supervised by Fluckinger with the most illuminating of results! Of course Paole’s corpse was present, but it had not decomposed in any way, and the blood in his veins still flowed as if living. The nails on his hands and feet had also fallen off - to be replaced by freshly grown ones.

Concluding that Paole must really be a vampire - and therefore responsible for the deaths in the village - a stake was driven through his heart causing him to bleed profusely and give an otherworldly moan! To be absolutely certain of his death Paole’s remains have been burned to ashes and tipped back into the grave. Of course proof of Paole’s vampirism is proof that he infected those he killed with his own malady, so each corpse has been afforded the same treatment.

Fluckinger is compiling his notes regarding this incident, along with other episodes of a similar nature, for his upcoming report to the Emperor ""Visum et Repertum"" - or ""Seen and Discovered""."	false

events_event_text_rosetta_stone	"An object of great interest has been unearthed during construction work at the Egyptian port of Rosetta. Standing over one metre high and almost as wide, the artifact is a piece of granite engraved with what appears to be a decree from a Ptolemaic-era Pharaoh in three languages.

The text appears first in classical Greek - a known language and the everyday language of the ruling Pharaoh of the time - and what appears to be two forms of ancient Egyptian Demotic and Hieroglyphic writing, both lost languages that have proved indecipherable to scholars of antiquity.

Apparently, during Ptolemaic rule official Pharaonic edicts and decrees were published in all three languages in order that subjects from all Egyptian sub-cultures could understand their meaning. It would appear that all the texts refer to the same decree, so it is hoped that translation of the Greek text will provide a key for translating the other languages.

The race is now on as academics from across Europe struggle to crack the code that has proved so elusive until now, but can reveal so much about the ancient world previously thought lost."	false

The skills of animal husbandry, however, are very different from those of the hunter. Both need an understanding of animals, but a herder needs to know how to care for his charges, not just how to kill them. Other than the turkey, there were no domesticated animals available in North America before the coming of the Europeans. Some tribes adapted quickly to the new opportunities that cows, pigs and sheep provided, but in so doing they made themselves vulnerable to animal-borne disease. In hunter-gatherer cultures men do not live in close proximity to their beasts, and are unlikely to be infected with their ailments."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_settlement_fortifications_improved	"

Extensive fortifications cost huge sums of money and much effort. There is little point in constructing them unless they are maintained and needed for the future survival and prosperity of a town. A defensive wall is good for a sense of security, but it does not feed a hungry family after a poor local harvest! As a practical matter, then, these fortifications are erected along borders and around towns of real strategic significance.

The defences are laid out according to the latest military fashions, and as well built as any purely military fortifications. This can cause local problems, as prime building land is either used for the forts themselves, or must be kept clear to provide excellent fields of fire. During long periods of peace, the city fathers must resist the temptation to cover the killing zones with houses and commercial properties!

Historically, fortresses created by Marshal Vauban of France dominated their towns for centuries. The defences of Strasbourg, in Alsace, are typical of his work, and were a clear geographical boundary until the end of the 19th Century."	false
events_event_text_robbie_burns	"A book of poetry and satire penned by a simple Scottish farmer and entitled ""Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect"" has been received with a surprising degree of enthusiasm.

Though having little formal education beyond that which his penniless father was able to give him, Robert Burns’ work has a direct, often humorous connection with its subject, and this rough honesty is heightened by the Scots dialect which the poet frequently employs.

Printed and published by John Wilson of Kilmarnock, the work is also known as the Kilmarnock Volume and its six hundred initial copies have long since sold out.

Burns provides an insight into the peasant’s way of life in ""The Cotter’s Saturday Night"" and ""The Twa Dogs"", whilst his ""To a Mouse"" and ""To a Mountain Daisy"" both reveal a tenderness towards the natural world and an awareness of the fragility of mortality.

Though the work has received plaudits further afield, Burns’ popularity is at its strongest amongst his fellow Scots, whose pride has been stirred to see their native tongue raised to the level of noble art."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_physiocracy	"

Physiocracy means “ruled by nature” and this perfectly sums up the attitude of the theory’s adherents. They believe that land is the only profitable commodity man can own, and should be the sole concentration of those attempting to make a successful living.

The idea is also based on the assumption that humans are instinctively selfish and as such will always act to the benefit of themselves before others. Physiocrats believe that this human characteristic is vital to a thriving economy. If a ruler hampers the move forward by levying taxes, imposing regulations and generally attempting to control the flow of trade he will prevent the creation of wealth and stunt wealth generation.

As leaders in the development of physiocracy, the French created the theory of “laissez-faire.” This helped to explain their views on the amount of input a ruler should have on trade, and became an influential idea still used to promote economic liberalism today"	false

events_event_text_electrical_condenser	"Dutch physicist Pieter van Musschenbroek has demonstrated his new invention, the ""Leyden Jar"". The device, which van Musschenbroek calls a ""condenser"", shows that two closely spaced metal plates with a glass jar separating them are capable of condensing a high density of electrical charge and storing it in an electrical field between them - the effect being due to the insulating properties of the intervening glass.

This brilliant innovation is an important development in our striving to understand and master the mysterious force of electricity. Now what would happen if several jars were combined in parallel?"	false

The appearance of the fearsome Petun Wolf Warriors, cloaked in animal skins and daubed in war paint, is enough to put terror in the stoutest of hearts! Their tomahawks can be used in close combat or flung from afar, but the effect on an enemy’s skull will remain constant and terrible! If a warrior defeats an enemy’s courage the battle is already half won: only the messy business of hacking at the flesh remains undone.

The Petun were part of the Huron Confederacy and lived in what is now Southern Ontario. The Petun’s name comes from the tobacco plant that they cultivated, smoked and traded. Tobacco was commonly used by the Native Americans, as they believed it to be a gift from the Creator. Due to its sacred origins, tobacco was used in offerings to the spirits, charms and incantations. It was also used for medicinal purposes and smoked to mark important social occasions, deals or decisions."	false

This is simply an open pit – the word quarry is hardly appropriate, as that would imply some sort of organisation – where workers scrabble in the mud to find gemstones. As miners are only paid for what they find, it is possible for men to work for days or weeks shifting mud and rock without seeing a single penny. The prospect of finding that one, valuable strike is enough to keep them going, even when the risk of the pit collapsing is great.

Others work the spoil heaps, searching for valuable stones that have been thrown aside in the rush to delve into the earth. What with the diggings, the shantytown that surrounds the workings, and the spoil heaps, an open pit is an eyesore. It is also some of the most valuable real estate in the world."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_dhow	"

The design of the dhow has remained unchanged over hundreds of years; it simply doesn’t need to be improved. Used throughout the Arab world as trading boats, pirates also favour them because of their good handling, and relatively high speed. That said, the design may well be Indian in origin, later adopted by Arab seafarers. A well-handled dhow has the advantage over many European rigged ships, in that it can stay out of the firing footprint of most lumbering ships and yet is quick enough to be able to escape in even the lightest of breezes. 

The lateen (or triangular) sail is also ancient design. It is not, however, perfect for all conditions. The canted lateen yardarm is difficult to handle in stormy conditions with a small crew. This may explain why the sailing rig is favoured in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and around the Arabian peninsular rather than the Atlantic. The construction method of stitching the planks together is a unique feature of the dhow. 

Historically, Europeans tended to use the term “dhow” indiscriminately to mean any vessel rigged with lateen sails. An Arab sailor would make a much finer distinction, based on the hull configuration."	false

However, would-be alchemist Bottger is known to be prone to mild exaggeration, so much so that a cash-starved monarch once detained him until he produced gold from base metals! It is unclear quite how Bottger managed to keep his head on that occasion.

Sober sources suggest the ""Meissen"" porcelain formula belongs to von Tschirnhaus, but the industrialisation of the process has been realised by Bottger."	false

The performance at Cliveden comprised a masque entitled ""Alfred"" - the tale of the Medieval English king no less. The audience were so stirred by the ardent patriotism of ""Rule, Britannia"" that there was very nearly uproar! Everyone from the high to the low has been whistling or humming the melody ever since, and alehouses the length and breadth of the land are resonating to the steady bull-like roaring of the chorus ""Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves! Britons never, never, never shall be slaves!""

The small stones form only the top layer: beneath are further layers of compacted stones and rubble, each compressed by both design and continuing traffic. The roadbed itself drains well, and can support large volumes of traffic and individually heavy items such as cannons.

Historically, the most famous and effective land route in world was probably the collection of toll roads and turnpikes known as the “Grand Trunk” in India. Much of it was little more than compacted dirt (mud in the rainy season) but large parts were well constructed. Trade, the lifeblood of the continent, and many armies, passed up and down the Grand Trunk over the centuries, from the wilds of the mountainous borders with Afghanistan to the rich provinces of the South. The Grand Trunk was also the murderous hunting ground of members of the Thuggee cult. These followers of the Hindu goddess Kali would befriend unsuspecting travellers, put them at their ease and then murder and rob them as an act of sacrament. Oddly, not all Thugs were Hindu; Muslims and Sikhs were found in their ranks, probably for the loot."	false

battles_description_chesapeake_vs_shannon	"During the War of 1812, the new United States Navy found itself at war with the Royal Navy. Even with its massive commitments in Europe against Napoleonic France, the British still had eighty-five ships in American waters compared to just twenty-two US ships.

The US Navy therefore relied on hit-and-run tactics and the skill of its crews. It also had some frigates that were far more powerful than their British equivalents.

A string of defeats left some British captains hungry for revenge. Captain Sir Philip Broke of the HMS Shannon was particularly looking forward to clashing with the Americans. On patrol off Boston, Broke issued a challenge to Captain James Lawrence of the USS Chesapeake.

The Chesapeake was already looking for the Shannon and what happened next would be perhaps the greatest ship-to-ship duel in the entire history of the Age of Sail.

Take control of the Shannon and see if you can repeat history.

Historically the battle was short but very bloody, lasting just sixteen minutes with the Shannon emerging victorious thanks to its crew’s superior gunnery skills. Lawrence was amongst those killed in the battle."	false

Organised as light infantry but armed with rifles rather than smoothbore muskets, riflemen have every right to see themselves as elite. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they do not need close supervision by their officers. These crack shots are trained for ranged combat and will be found wanting if they engage in melee. At their best in cover, their loose formation makes them a tough target for line infantry, and their uniforms allow them to blend into the landscape as they stalk their human prey.

The men of Morgan’s Provisional Rifle Corps were seen by many, including George Washington, as elite soldiers; they were well acquainted with the use of a rifle and were expert marksmen. This exceptional reputation meant they were chosen to accompany Benedict Arnold to attack Quebec. The attack began during a blinding snowstorm and ended in failure. Morgan did manage to get a few of his men over the wall and in to the city, something which no other American achieved."	false

Whereas Herr Kant’s early career encompassed impressive astronomical discoveries, he is now more celebrated as one of the leading philosophers of the age.

The Critique is an attempt to bridge the gap between rationalism and empiricism, considering the relationship between knowledge gained by reason and that gained by experience. This theory is described by the author as ""transcendental idealism"" - in essence that empirical knowledge is real, but cannot comprehend that which transcends the cognitive faculties."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_swiss_guard	"

Resplendent in bright red uniforms, the Swiss Guard is recruited in the cantons of Switzerland. Armed with smoothbore muskets, these men are not just a decorative, court regiment, but very capable warriors, certainly the betters of ordinary line infantry units. Their origins mean that they can be trusted not to involve themselves in French conspiracies. French monarchs are not the first to realise that foreign soldiers are often hated and distrusted more than the monarchy itself by many internal enemies! The Swiss Guard, therefore, live and die in the service of the throne because, viewed cynically, their survival demands it.

In August 1792, France was in turmoil. King Louis XVI (1774-92) was a hollow, hated figurehead. The Swiss Guard were his last line of defence, guarding the Tuileries Palace when the revolutionaries attacked. The Bourbons escaped, but hundreds of their loyal Swiss Guards were killed. Many survivors succumbed to their wounds or were murdered during the September Massacres. Finally, in 1821 a statue was erected in Lucerne to commemorate the sacrifice made by the Swiss Guard. It depicts a dying lion, symbolically protecting the French monarchy."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_winnebago_warriors	"

The Winnebago are not the most forgiving of tribes, and do not forget a transgression easily. On the battlefield, they are fearsome fighters in a melee whenever they are allowed to close with enemies. The thrill of battle is their strength and joy.

Away from the battlefield, many an envoy has met the wrong end of a tomahawk or ended up in a Winnebago’s belly after mistakenly thinking they could be bargained with or bought.

By 1665, a series of misfortunes caused the Winnebago’s numbers to dwindle to five hundred: there was a disastrous storm, and an epidemic decimated the tribe. The remainder starved as they were too weak from disease to harvest their crops. Seeing the Winnebago so depleted, their former Illinois enemies sent them food and warriors as an act of goodwill. The newcomers were welcomed, and then killed during a celebration feast. The vengeful Illinois waited until they had an opportunity to attack, during the Winnebagos’ winter hunt and almost wiped them out. Only at the end of the Beaver Wars was the tribe restored by intermarriage with Algonquin refugees."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_ironmasters_works_european	"

Blacksmiths can only produce small quantities of good quality iron, and small items, thanks to their reliance on muscle power for all work. The ironmasters have the financial backing and imagination to scale up the production of iron, and use water power to force air into the furnaces and power machines to work the metal. Where there is a plentiful supply of coal, water and ore, the ironmasters can make a profit.

The Industrial Revolution and the modern world we now live in owe their existence to one small valley in Shropshire, England. Coalbrookdale had good supplies of water and coal and this encouraged Abraham Darby to establish his coke-burning foundry there to make iron (there had been foundries in Coalbrookdale before, producing cannon shot among other things). Charcoal-powered furnaces were becoming uneconomic, as the demand for wood outstripped supply, hence the switch to coal and coke. Darby’s methods were revolutionary and the family business went from strength to strength. The production of high-quality iron generated demand for more; the Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, for example, demonstrated that iron was a superb construction material, thanks to the efforts of Abraham’s grandson, also called Abraham."	false
building_description_texts_long_description_wooden_fort_european	"

As a defensive work, it is well able to withstand enemy attacks when properly defended by stalwart men; a garrison should expect to hold out against attacks for some little time. The walls are high enough to give a good firing position to any defenders, and any aggressor had better bring a ladder or particularly acrobatic attackers to a siege! The walls are only the most visible part of the defence: the surrounding trees and undergrowth are cut back to provide a clear firing – and therefore killing – ground for the defenders. This cleared ground often extends well beyond musket range, to deny attackers the chance to approach unseen.

Unlike a stockade, a fort is a relative permanent structure and, as such, it serves to mark ownership of territory as much as to command the surrounding area. Forts are positioned with an eye to using the existing terrain, commanding any strategic approaches (such as passes and river crossings) and intimidating the natives."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_norwegian_ski_troops	"

Though they fight on foot, the skis with which these men are equipped allow them a greater range of operation in winter than ordinary troops. Their knowledge of their snowbound environment is a valuable asset which can be used to great advantage.

The mountainous terrain of Scandinavia, shrouded in wintry conditions for much of each year, serves to severely restrict the mobility of conventional troops. The local populace have adapted to these challenges in a number of ways, perhaps the most significant of which is their use of skis. With skis, a man can travel for many miles in the time, while a walking man would exhaust himself blundering a few hundred yards through the snow.

Lightly-equipped mountain or winter specialists give a commander many more options about where to attack in this kind of terrain. Ski troopers excel at a hit-and-run style of warfare, ideal for harassing and isolating an enemy. Able to travel surprising distances in a short space of time, they will attack an enemy from an unexpected quarter, fading away before an effective pursuit can be organised."	false

While the people do not have to be listened to, it is a wise course of action to consult them in local matters. The process may be real or a fig leaf, but one result is that the council takes the blame for poor decisions, not the Crown and its governors, beys or thalurs! The propertied classes and local dignitaries on the council almost certainly owe their advisory status entirely to their wealth or social position: democracy may play a part, but the franchise is likely to be very limited indeed. The lower social orders are unlikely to be given any say in how they are governed.

This lack of broad consultation is not as bad as it sounds. The government cannot overstep the bounds of its power. There is a contract (or even an informal understanding) between government and governed as to what the Crown may do without the consent of the people (the people being those with a stake in the country – men of property in other words). Historically, this is essentially the model that the British arrived at: the King and his ministers ruled, but needed Parliament to raise taxes and pay for everything!"	false

A tribe that fails to keep pace with an enemy risks leaving itself vulnerable to attack. However, sometimes the best course of action is to trade, rather than to try to make everything. The Europeans are greedy for furs, and there is no shortage of hunters who can get them. Hard bargaining can bring many guns, until the tribe’s smiths can learn the necessary skills.

In the 1600s, European settlers supplied guns to the native tribes , through trade or as gifts to secure alliances. As tribes adopted firearms, they quickly became a necessity. A people without guns ran the risk of destruction by enemies armed with the new weapons. Though the tribes did gain some independence from European suppliers by learning metalworking and gun maintenance, making gunpowder remained a slow and difficult process. The natives still had to rely on foreigners for powder, putting them at a distinct disadvantage."	false

The Grand Duke, clearly a man of little constitution, has fallen under the sway of the pernicious text ""On Crimes and Punishments"" by Cesare Beccaria - which agonises about the futility of capital punishment in a most spineless manner! As such he has steadily blocked all proposed executions since coming to power.

Now he has permanently enshrined his mistaken viewpoint in the laws of the land, leading no doubt to wild celebrations amongst the criminal classes.

Tuscany has the very dubious honour of being the first European power to ban capital punishment, sparking debate regarding the potential benefits their society might derive from this. However, the ordinary right-thinking man is left to consider this as nothing less than stark-staring lunacy - to ponder what the world is coming to and where this will all end!"	false

The graduates of this school are armed with theological arguments against other branches of Christianity, and a sense of mission to spread the truth of Protestantism as widely as possible. Intellectual effort is expected over and above simple-minded faith.

Originally, many western European universities were based on religious teaching establishments, where divinity was the main (and sometimes only) field of study. Their graduates were granted doctorates, indicating that they were qualified to teach theology to others. However, the universities were also often tied to the established Catholic Church, and Protestantism was a revolt precisely against the failings of established religion. Where Protestantism replaced Catholicism as the official state religion, teaching changed to remove “papist” doctrine and error. This did not, however, prevent further, lesser schisms such as the rise of non-conformist sects like Methodism. These nonconformists also wished to teach their views, and they were often denied teaching places at universities."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_64_lber_fort_carronade	"

Originally developed for naval warfare where their light weight and awesome firepower made them ideal aboard ship, carronades are also very useful for the close-in defence of fortifications. Their limited range is not an issue, as an enemy has to come within range when an assault is mounted; the exact opposite would be the case in a field battle, where the battery could easily be outflanked by staying out of range.

Historically, the Carron Company of Scotland developed the weapon to supplement the long guns carried on Royal Navy ships. Despite the weight of shot fired, the powder charge was not large. This meant that the barrel did not need to be heavy (it did not have to resist high pressures) or long. This lower charge also reduced recoil and, unfortunately, weapon range: there is always a trade-off to be made somewhere. That said, carronades could do horrendous damage: a 64-pounder would fire a solid shot of that weight and a canister of 500 musket balls could be packed into the barrel as well! No attacking force would relish facing that kind of danger."	false

As a force, they are the cream of the Ottoman army but, in comparison to some other nations, they fight in a slightly old fashioned way. This is small comfort to those who stand against them, as the janissaries are personally brave to the point of foolhardiness. They are also given to festooning themselves with weapons and hurling themselves into any fray!

Historically, the corps of janissaries (the term means “new soldiers”) dates back to the 14th Century. They were intended to replace the unreliable ghazi tribal warriors with a force indoctrinated to be completely loyal to the Sultan. This was achieved by taking boys as young as five for training and conversion to Islam if required. The janissaries had their own corps of engineers, supply troops and were even paid regularly, whether they were at war or not! Over time, however, they came to be used as bureaucrats and administrators, and this gave them too much power over the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the janissaries’ entrenched position in government became arrogance and an entrenched position against change, and so helped the Ottomans to stagnate and decline."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rice_paddies_european	"

Paddy fields require backbreaking labour by farmers to plant, maintain and harvest the rice crops. Flooded fields do not readily lend themselves to any kind of labour-saving devices, and all domesticated draft animals (other than the water buffalo) suffer when used to cultivate rice paddies. A large amount of manual labour is also required to maintain the elaborate system of waterways and dykes needed to keep fields flooded to the right depth. Too much water will ruin a rice crop just as surely as too little. All of this needs manual labour, a class of peasants to work the land constantly.

Historically, rice is one of the oldest cultivated crops; no one is quite sure when and where it was first domesticated. Humans have domesticated wild rice strains more than once in separate parts of the world, including dry field variants that grow like other cereals. Rice remains one of the vital food crops of the world."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_division_of_labour	"

As society expands its capabilities and needs grow with it. By dividing labour amongst workers a manufactory owner can develop a more skilled and effective work force, in turn leading to a quicker production time and larger profits. Allocating workers to specific tasks creates a more skilled and knowledgeable work force, capable of passing their knowledge on to others.

Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723-90) was a firm proponent of the division of labour. He argued that the rate of production would be dramatically increased within industry if work was divided effectively. In “The Wealth of Nations”, he called for a public education system to be put in place to teach workers the finer points of their craft. Economist William Petty took a different view point: he argued that the main purpose of the division of labour was creating a more skilled work force, rather than speeding up production times"	false

These mounted warriors are armed with muskets and axes; their strength lies in the flexibility these weapons give them on the battlefield. They can unleash a barrage of firepower on an enemy then use their axes to terrible effect when charging home. By targeting the enemy flank or rear, they can break units on their own.

In 1813 the Creek nation was divided by a civil war, that came to be known as the Red Stick War. The Red Sticks were Creek who believed the tribe should return to the traditional ways of life and reject American influences. When a group of Red Sticks were executed by the Creeks for killing two settler families it sparked a tribal war, with the Americans joining the fight. The Red Sticks lost, and Colonel Andrew Jackson forced the Creeks to cede twenty million acres of land to the US Government, regardless of Creek loyalties. Jackson later became President, and was responsible for the controversial Indian Removal Act of 1830."	false

events_event_text_encyclopedie_published	"Originally intended as a translation of Englishman Ephraim Chambers' groundbreaking ""Cyclopedia"" of 1728, work towards the Encyclopédie began in earnest in 1747, following several false starts.

Finally settling on Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d’Alambert as editors, the Encyclopédie made use of some of the finest brains in France, including Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu and Louis de Jaucourt to name but four. In total, over seventy thousand articles have been published along with over three thousand illustrations in thirty five volumes, beginning in 1751.

Whereas the enlightened minds of France see the Encyclopedie as a means of breaking down superstitions and raising the level of general knowledge of the common man, there are those who see such things as dangerous sedition that takes power away from the church.

After being officially shut down in 1759, work continued in secret under high-born patronage until completed in 1772 - the authorities secretly turning a blind eye, whilst at the same time appearing to appease the wishes of the church."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pottery_workshops_european	"

A pottery workshop needs only a supply of clay – something that can be found almost anywhere in the world – and charcoal for the kiln, and the charcoal is optional if unfired “greenware” is being made. Most pottery produced is earthenware. Even with a highly skilled potter, there is a limit to how much can be produced. Pottery is a batch-production process, and the rate of production is limited by the size of the potter’s kiln and the time needed for the kiln to cool safely after firing a batch. That said, if an entire community is engaged in the trade, it is possible to make significant numbers of small batches.

Pottery was one of the earliest types of human manufactured items. The process of making ceramics barely changed in hundreds of years: an 18th Century potter would have had no trouble working in a Roman or Ancient Egyptian pottery works, for example.  Many local styles evolved over time, partly thanks to the difficulty of moving (relatively fragile) goods any distance by land."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_brig	"

The term “brig” is a contraction of “brigantine” (an earlier sailing ship design), although the two types do not have the same rigging. A brigantine carries fore-and-aft sails, while a brig is square-rigged; this explains why the brig was favoured, for square rigging requires far fewer skilled hands to sail the vessel. The term “brig” could also include many rigging sets, including the strangely named “hermaphrodite brig”, which had a square-rigged forward mast and schooner-rigged aft (main) mast. 

All brigs, in the hands of a good captain, are handy little ships, and can virtually turn in their own length. This manoeuvrability partly makes up for the light armament, usually no more than a couple of cannon – and those no larger than 12-lbers. The development of carronades (short-barrelled, short-range, large-bore weapons) added to a brig’s firepower. 

Historically, the fledgling United States Navy used brigs, particularly on the Great Lakes. USN brigs also put up a brave account of themselves against the Barbary Pirates."	false

The Garde à Cheval are a court regiment where appearance is just as important as fighting prowess. The gentlemen of this unit (and they are all gentlemen) are not the common sort of soldier, and they are not respected by the rest of the army. Often, they are also unloved by the people too, as they stand with the monarch, and this can mean taking a sabre to their own countrymen.

Historically, from 1721 the Russian throne was protected by a mounted guard regiment, a unit drawn almost exclusively from the nobility. Because of their duties and control of access to the Imperial family, the Garde à Cheval had significant political power. Although drawn from the nobility, the original guards were not appointed for their military skills: as the bodyguards of the Empress Elizabeth, they were chosen for their other “endowments”.

Not everyone who wants to be a warrior is accepted as such by his own people. A chance to distinguish oneself on the battlefield is a way to gain status in the eyes of the tribe, and if this means fighting for Europeans in their wars, then so be it. The Europeans value their native fighters for their skilled field craft and bravery. There are also the spoils of war to consider.

Many Native Americans were employed as scouts and fighters along the frontier. From a European perspective, it made sense to keep potentially dangerous men under close supervision, and to use their aggression against enemies rather than having it turned against the colonists."	false

There is no environment harsher than the desert, and the nomadic tribesmen who inhabit it are as pitiless as the shifting sands. The trackless sandy wastes are littered with the bones of those foolish enough to have ventured there in defiance of those who call this place home. Nomads are experts in using the desert to defeat an enemy before risking an attack, although they tend to fare less well in cooler climes. The nomads’ camels can withstand searing temperatures which would quickly exhaust a horse – and no horse is happy with the sound and smell of camels either!

A common nomad tactic is to allow the intense heat of the desert to weaken their foe, then to thin their numbers with fire from their archaic-looking matchlocks. Despite their ancient appearance, these muskets are always well-maintained and used to deadly effect. Once the enemy has begun to falter, nomads risk a more direct attack, closing for the kill with their scimitars. The weird ululating battle cries favoured by the nomadic tribesmen are often amongst the last sounds heard by their exhausted and dispirited victims!"	false

Steam-powered machines offer a way of creating unlimited goods of many kinds in an efficient manner. This enormous ironworks designs, develops and creates new static steam engines of many kinds, from the beam engines used to pump water out of mines, to the stationary engines used to haul plateway wagons, and the complicated expansion engines that provide power to other machines. Each new technical advance can be applied to work of the shop itself, and other manufactories soon benefit from any improvements, if they pay for the engineers’ work.

The “shock of the new” in the 18th Century was immense and nowhere more so than in the factories and mills that steam engines made possible. Workers’ lives were transformed overnight, and they had to master many strange new concepts: steam engines could be dangerous things. It’s worth remembering that many workers were killed by poorly installed or maintained engines, boiled alive thanks to steam explosions or mangled by a lack of safety features. Safety valves to release excess pressure were fitted not only to save lives, but also the expense of rebuilding if a boiler did explode!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rice_farms_european	"

Rice does require extensive earthworks in terms of ditches, dykes and watercourses. Without a substantial and controllable supply of fresh water, crop yields will suffer. By moving away from a peasant-level growing pattern, where each farmer is responsible only for his fields and nothing else, a rice farm takes maximum advantage of the available land and water supply.

Although rice is an important crop, it is not a complete diet in itself. The causes and cures of dietary “diseases” (actually, deficiencies) were dimly understood by 18th medical men, if indeed they were seen as being problems caused by poor diet at all. Doctors knew fresh food helped people with scurvy, but why this worked was a complete mystery. Other dietary mysteries, such as beriberi, were equally impenetrable. In that case, white rice, often seen as a higher-status dish than brown, un-husked rice, can be the cause of beriberi. Rice husk contains a relative large amount of thiamine (vitamin B1), the lack of which causes beriberi, a crippling condition. The causes and cure for beriberi, which was endemic in some parts of Asia, remained unknown until the early 20th Century."	false

The palace name reflects the auspicious day Shaniwar (Saturday), 10 January 1730 when the foundation stones were placed by the prime minister, Baji Rao, of the Maratha Empire. This wada (or residential complex) was never intended for the king, but to be an official residence for prime ministers and his administration of the Maratha Empire. No expense was spared in its construction: every door in the building was hand-carved from the finest teak; every floor was the finest marble available. The palace took two years to complete, and later prime ministers made it grander still, adding bastions, and magnificent gardens.

When designed, the Shaniwar Wada was as much a fortress as palace. An army attempting to breach its gates faced formidable defences.

The building still exists, although it is much reduced from its former grandeur. A fire in 1828 destroyed much of the original, leaving only the granite structures undamaged."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_opera_house_indian	"

India is the birthplace of many cultures and arts, and the ruling classes have enough money to demand – and pay for – the best of everything. This creates a demand for skilled artisans of many kinds, and a demand for training in the arts from rich dilettantes who wish to dabble for themselves and, after all, an educated patron can spend his money wisely. There are schools specialising in every art, from erotic temple statuary to manuscript illumination – and everything in between.

Historically, some of the finest buildings and artistic achievements in India were created during the period of Mughal rule, in a style that can be called Islamo-Indian. The Islamic Mughal ruling class appreciated the skills of their Hindu subjects, and made full use of them in creating a rich and beautiful environment. At places like Lahore Fort, later rulers continued the tradition of architectural and artistic excellence."	false

events_event_text_masked_man_dies	"At the Bastille in Paris, a mysterious prisoner has died after over thirty years in captivity.

Debate has raged concerning the identity of the man, buried as ""Marchioly"", but who many believe was the twin brother of the King of France! Rumours continue to persist as official correspondence refers to the man by a different name, ""Dauger"".

It also reveals that he was allowed contact with some prisoners, but not those who may have known him before his incarceration and could reveal his identity. Adding further to the intrigue, the prisoner was moved whenever the governor was reassigned, and always wore a black velvet or iron mask to conceal his face during transportation.

His true identity may never be known, but it seems likely that the prisoner was a Marshal of France, fallen from favour - but still the chattering classes ask: just who was this masked man, and could he have been the rightful King?"	false

An eccentric man with a violent temper, Ferrers' wife had already secured a legal separation for cruelty, and he once kicked a servant so hard in the groin that the fellow was unable to hold water for some time afterwards.

As his estates were vested to trustees, a steward was appointed to receive rents on his behalf. Unfortunately, the man was a loyal servant of the trustees and did not act in accordance with Ferrers' wishes, so having summoned him to a business meeting at his home, Ferrers shot him at point blank range.

Despite offering money to the man’s relatives to keep the matter quiet, and a subsequent plea of insanity (backed up by considerable evidence!), Ferrers was found guilty and hanged at Tyburn."	false

start_pos_factions_description_2	"The United Provinces are a Protestant stronghold in North-western Europe, a place where science, trade and freedom of thought have flourished since the Spanish were driven out in the last century. Having tamed their land and held back the sea, the Dutch have also embraced the sea and become the foremost naval power in the world. A mere generation ago, the Dutch navy sailed into the Thames and burned the English fleet at anchor: this kind of bravado and expertise is not quickly forgotten.

Dutch merchantmen range across the world’s oceans, and the wealth of the world passes through Dutch ports. Dutchmen can be found trading in the Indies, where they give the locals a run for their money, and the Caribbean. They are everywhere, in fact, where there is a profit to be made. Spanish claims to the New World and its trade are cheerfully ignored, as are Spanish threats. The Dutch have learned to live with Hapsburg threats hanging over their heads. Having beaten off brutal attempts to bring them to heel, the Dutch now have little love for Hapsburg-ruled Spain or Austria. A distant Catholic emperor holds no appeal for them. An expansionist France, on the other hand, does bear watching, and guarding against.

Other rivals close at hand are now less of a threat than they used to be. The British have been… tamed is too strong a word… brought to their senses by having a good, honest Dutchman on their throne. William III of Orange was an acceptable Protestant ruler for the British when they needed one. His presence has done much to calm relations, especially as the equally-mercantile British have designs on world trade that should rightfully be Dutch!

For the future, the Dutch have much to be hopeful about. They have a strong navy, and a tradition of victory. There is wealth aplenty in every corner of the world, if only the Dutch have the will to go and take it!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_steam_ship	"

By fitting a steam engine and all its machinery into an existing hull, naval architects hoped to create a ship-of-the-line not tied to the wind and tide. In this, they were moderately successful. A steamship can sail independently of the prevailing winds, but most still spend a good deal of time under sail. Coal is expensive, and coaling stations are few and far between; steam is not a practical method of strategic movement.

Tactically, however, it is a different story. With powerful guns, a steamship can out-manoeuvre any sailing ship. Admittedly, the idea of going into battle with a fire raging in the belly of his ship is not one that appeals to every captain. Boiler explosions are not entirely unknown either, as safety features are installed as the fancy takes the engineer, not as a matter of course. A stray shot through the engine room can also do terrible damage.

Historically, The conversion of ships of the line to steam was never going to be anything more than a stopgap measure. Steamships, with their dirt and smoke, were not popular with traditionally minded captains, particularly in the British Royal Navy. They expected obsessively high standards of neatness and cleanliness, with no soot and lubricating oil smeared over their nice clean ships."	false

battles_description_battle_of_rossbach	"At the outbreak of the Seven Years War Prussia was surrounded, and Frederick II of Prussia marched into Saxony and defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Lobositz. He then turned south to capture Prague. After winning a bloody siege, his apparently invincible army suffered their first loss at the Battle of Kolin.

The Holy Roman Empire and Austria took the offensive, preparing attacks on multiple fronts. Frederick, after assessing the situation, marched to the west to meet a combined French and Holy Roman Empire force led by General Prince de Soubise. With Frederick’s army outnumbered 2 to 1, the armies attempted to outmanoeuvre each other, but reached a stalemate at Rossbach.

Now, how will Frederick face the fast approaching Allied forces? Faced with such odds, will the Prussians regain their reputation as an invincible army?"	false

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_natives_military_ironworking	"

As America becomes home to an increasing number of European settlers, gunpowder weapons have become widespread. It is therefore useful for native nations to manufacture and maintain guns for themselves, instead of relying on trade with foreigners for weapons. Ironworking is a new practice for many, but vital if the tribes are to survive.

Historically, the Navajo and Hopi peoples were famed for their ability to make jewellery; silversmithing was particularly advanced among the Navajo. Other metalworking skills could be added to these methods, as the scale might be different but the principles were the same."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_4th_rate_frigate_standard	"

A frigate is a single-deck, square-rigged warship, generally used as a scouting vessel for the main battle fleet or as a “cruiser”, sent out to operate independently and cause trouble to enemies in far off waters. Frigates have the speed to chase down merchantmen, and the fighting power to overwhelm them easily.

Although strictly a contradiction in terms, the “fourth rate frigate” is a powerful vessel, easily having the firepower of a “fourth rate” ship of the line, allied to the sailing characteristics and speed of a frigate. Early examples of these 44-gun single deck ships carried 24-pounder cannons on the lower deck; later examples were constructed that carried 32-pounders! With the development of carronades (short-barrelled, short-ranged cannons that were never counted in the official gun rating), this gave them a weight of shot that equalled or exceeded that of many smaller ships of the line. 

Historically, the United States Navy, in particular, had a habit of building strong and oversize ships, possibly because they plentiful timber in America’s virgin forests, and because the weather in the Atlantic required strong ships. As with all frigates, these ships were plum appointments for ambitious or greedy captains – independence of action and the chance of prize money were a heady combination!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_improved_grape_shot	"

Grape shot is usually a canvas bag that contains a large number of small cannon balls. These are usually larger than the musket balls used in canister shot for land-based artillery, as they are expected to blast through wooden ships. Indeed, a part of their terrible killing effect comes from the fact that they not only spread out from the gun barrel when fired, but also shatter the target into equally deadly splinters. “Splinter” in this case can mean a lethally pointed piece of wood as long as a man’s torso!

Improved grape shot puts the killing balls into a cylindrical container with a wooden base or “sabot” (shoe), that acts as a piston when the cannon fires. Improved grapeshot can therefore do even more damage to the crew of a target.

Historically, a broadside of grapeshot from HMS Swallow killed the infamous pirate Bartholomew “Black Bart” Roberts in 1722. However, grapeshot was normally used to “rake” enemy ships by firing into the bow or stern. With no transverse bulkheads to absorb any damage, few would survive such an attack."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_native_american_artillery	"

Artillery gives any war chief an awesome amount of power to strike down his enemies. It does, however, require careful handling in battle to make artillery work well with the informal tactics that many tribes use.

The art of making and repairing cannons is one that tribal smiths can understand, but it is not an easy process with their tools and resources.

Historically, the Native Americans never developed anything approaching an artillery corps. Heavy weapons did not suit their style of fighting and would have reduced the tribes’ strategic mobility too. The Europeans were also quite careful to prevent the tribes acquiring any cannons: the military independence that this would have granted was a step too far."	false

As such, the first press has been set up by Ibrahim Muteferrika - a Hungarian convert to Islam - and staffed by skilled Jewish workers who up until now have been printing exclusively in the Hebrew language.

There, he has begun production of a very popular dry stout beer which bears his name. Guinness stout is brewed with roasted local barley grains and water from the Wicklow Mountains to give it a characteristic taste and a dark ruby, almost black colour.

It is understood that if all goes well for Mr Guinness over the next 9,000 years, he may consider exporting a barrel or two of his excellent stout to England, and, who knows, perhaps even further afield! It might however, be too good to share."	false

One of the most powerful holy grounds is the medicine wheel. These areas are a representation of the path an individual must walk in their life time. By standing on each of the spokes a man can understand what it is to walk another’s path and fully appreciate all aspects of life and nature. 

Historically, the most famous medicine wheel is found at Big Horn in Wyoming; it was the first to be created and was built on a ridge of Medicine mountain. People visited the site seeking harmony with the powerful spirits that inhabited it, searching for a greater understanding of the mysteries of mother earth."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_church_school	"

In a time when basic education is not a right but a bought-and-paid-for privilege, the education provided by Church schools is often very good, as well as being the only option. There is, of course, a Scriptural emphasis in what is taught, but the sons of merchants, nobles and the wealthy can gain a good grounding for life and, possibly, further education. A few gifted pupils may be offered charitable scholarships, but these are few and the recipients are never permitted to forget that they should be showing appropriate gratitude. Patronage must always be appreciated!

Historically, learning had been the preserve of the established Church in many countries. A priest was both tutor and confessor in many communities and households. It also made sense for the Church to control access to education, for that way heresy and dissent could be stamped out early. For non-conformist preachers, offering education to paying clients was also a way of subsidizing their meagre income and spreading the Word of the Lord in the process."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_cobbled	"

Building a cobbled road is an incredibly laborious business. Each small paving stone must be shaped, placed and mortared into position. If done properly, the road also requires foundations, a careful camber to carry away rain water, and extensive drainage on either side. The end result is a fine road that is extremely durable, but not entirely comfortable for carts, carriages or foot traffic: cobbles can be hellishly bumpy!

Historically, the expense of cobbles, and the fine-looking result of cobbling a street, meant that they were often only used in or near towns or for high-status routes where the great and the good could not be expected to wallow in the mud like poor people. Cobbles, however, did serve the poor in another way: they were the perfect size for rioters! Levered out of place, they were the ideal thrown weapon (along with the half-house brick or “brickbat”) for a bit of informal remonstrating with any nearby unwelcome representatives of law and order."	false

Properly harnessed the power of dreams enables warriors to see through an enemy’s deceptions: hidden units can be hunted down before they can spring an ambush!

Native Americans believed strongly in prediction through dreams, and would make decisions guided by them, even abdicating leadership or turning back from a battle if a dream told them it was the right thing to do. Direction and purpose could be acquired by embarking on a vision quest. The vision seeker isolated himself, achieving a heightened condition through fasting, hallucinogens, or even self-mutilation, then waiting for the vision to appear. This often came in the form of a bird or animal, and once received would be followed without question; the seeker had to remain in harmony with the wishes of the Spirits."	false

Law and order are the basis of good, bad and indifferent government. Appointed as a judge for his local standing, the magistrate of a region often acts as an administrator, tax collector, thief-taker, leader in charitable good works, military recruiter and father figure to his community. A magistrate usually represents both the state and the landed classes. It is his task, as often as not, to protect the rights of property rather than of people, even when a republican regime is in power – liberty and equality are all very well, but the deserving rich need to be sure their wealth is safe!

Magistrates also often have the power to raise troops as formed units, and to send convicted men into the military as a punishment. The magistrate, therefore, becomes the first line of defence against the mob in times of disorder."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_grand_opera_house_european	"

Little expense is spared on a grand opera house, particularly in the “front of house” areas where the audience are to be found. A grand opera house is a magnificent structure, the equal of any palace in terms of luxurious appointments and detailing to overawe the visitors. The staged works can be equally elaborate, featuring enormous casts and intricate settings. This is conspicuous consumption raised to a high art, even before the music starts!

Many rulers in the 18th Century acted as a patron of the arts, and opera in particular. Apart from being fabulously and famously expensive (therefore demonstrating the patron’s wealth), the musical form was also growing in popularity and quality. The staging and music of opera advanced tremendously during the period, with works from composers of genius such as Mozart, Handel and Scarlatti. Emperor Joseph II of Austria, the “music king”, was particularly fortunate that his love of the art coincided with a flowering of musical talent in Europe. He used the arts as a subtle tool of nationalism, promoting a Germanic culture within Austria."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_hungarian_grenadiers	"

Recruited from the largest and strongest men available, grenadiers must be capable of throwing a grenade far enough away so that the subsequent explosion does not kill them! Even so, fuses are notoriously unreliable, and men sometimes die from premature explosions. Yet no matter how worrying grenades are for the grenadiers, they are definitely worse for the targets!

Grenadiers, thanks to their imposing stature, are also used as close-quarters shock troops, as they have the edge in a melee over smaller men.

Historically, Hungarian Grenadiers were a sight to behold on the battlefield in their magnificent uniforms. Hungarian units in the Austrian army were raised by feudal levy. Although the Austrians had an integrated military, Hungary remained a separate kingdom, even though it shared a Hapsburg monarch with Austria. Military enlistment in Austrian service was originally for life; in 1757 limited service was introduced in the hopes of attracting better recruits and thereby improving the calibre of the soldiers. Men were allowed to enlist for a maximum of 6 years or for the duration of the any hostilities, whichever was longer."	false

Trading in fur can often be a long-winded affair until the final customer is reached, as moving furs from the wilderness relies heavily on finding river routes to transport them. The use of wooden canoes allows the furs to be sent great distances in a much shorter time than if they had been sent by land.

Historically, many European outsiders that became 'woodsmen' actually took up the native way of life, adopting their clothing, lodgings and customs. Some married native women, thus creating bonds to the tribe that came with the benefit of free and easy trade."	false

The art of calligraphy and the skill of writing beautifully are important because they preserve and communicate the revelations of the Qur'an. 

The work of calligraphers is prized and collected for its inherent beauty, as well as its meaning. The mastery of the many styles and forms is a lifetime’s work, but one that can bring rich rewards. A student cannot sign work until he had received an “icazet” or diploma, granted for producing an examination piece in the presence of several teachers. Standards are exceptionally high, but a recognized calligrapher could expect to have his work treasured by his clients.

Calligraphy also forms the basis of some Islamic decoration (along with geometric arabesque art) and has a figurative style where interweaved words create images. These “calligrams” are both intricate and incredibly beautiful artworks. Calligraphy also has influences on other artistic endeavours, such as the creation of elaborate carpets and textiles."	false

events_event_text_reflexions_critiques	"""Reflexions Critiques sur les Histoires des Anciens Peuples"", a newly published work by the celebrated French orientalist Etienne Fourmont, is exciting great interest in the nature of myth.

The work is very learned, seeking to establish common links between the deities and mythological figures of various civilisations. Professor Fourmont’s formidable linguistic skills have enabled him to examine the roots of words and mythical names, thereby tracing their development through various cultures and establishing commonalities. By this method he has arrived at a number of surprising conclusions, amongst them that Abraham is one and the same being with Saturn from the ancient Roman pantheon - and thus that the god Jupiter and Abraham’s son Isaac are also the same.

Fourmont’s reasoning, backed as it is by layer upon layer of detailed examples and etymological proofs - however tenuous - is proving very difficult to dispute. His ideas have sparked a debate on the nature of mankind that seems set to run for some time yet."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_steam_engine	"

The power comes from letting steam into a cylinder beneath a piston, and then cooling it rapidly. The partial vacuum created sucks the piston down the cylinder; more steam then enters and is cooled, creating a backwards-and-forwards stroke that can be converted by cams into rotary motion. The engine itself remains stationary, but its power can be transferred by axles, gears and belts to other machines. Some steam engines are simply harnessed to pumps and the reciprocating motion of the piston is used to lift water out of mines.

A steam engine requires water and fuel, but it can be installed anywhere. As long as a fire burns and the boiler has water, it will provide profitable power to a mill or mine.

The practical steam engine was the brainchild of Scotsman James Watt (1736-1819), who improved the earlier machines of Thomas Newcomen and others. It was Watt who first used the term “horsepower” as a measure of an engine’s output – something that still brings joy to all modern petrolheads! He was also honoured by giving his name to the SI unit of derived power, the watt."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_seed_planting_drill	"

The seed drill replaces the old method of a farm hand simply walking the fields and scattering seed by hand onto the ground. Instead of wasting seeds or allowing them to be eaten by birds and scavengers, the drill plants them in a controlled manner. Seeds are poured into a hopper, and then a cunning mechanical contrivance assures that each is properly buried at the right depth. Wastage is reduced, the plants have the correct amount of room, and crop yields are increased.

The inventor, Jethro Tull (1674-1741), was a practical man and a believer in empirical studies to determine the truth. He was of the opinion that plants gained much of their nutrition from the soil, and that it made sense to both improve it and remove weeds with an eye to increasing harvests. His seed drill was only one of his inventions that aided the Agricultural Revolution in Britain. This (forcibly) freed workers from the rural economy and drove them to seek work in the new mills of the Industrial Revolution."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_theatre_middle_east	"

The word came to English through Italian, where the Turkish “serai” (palace) was confused with the Latin word “sera” (door-bar). A “serai” was any grand palace built around a courtyard, not just a harem. Despite this confusion, there were separate quarters for concubines (Circassian girls were highly prized for their reputedly amazing good looks), and access was tightly controlled.

The whole idea of a seraglio became something of an obsession in Western Europe, and the subject matter of many works of art in “Turkish” Oriental style, which was quite popular during the 18th Century. Obviously, it combined the exotic and the naughtily erotic in tasteful pictures for the rich! The concept provided the inspiration for Mozart’s opera, “Die Entführung aus dem Serail” (Abduction from the Seraglio), where the hero attempts to rescue his love from the clutches of an Ottoman Pasha. First performed in Austria in 1782 under the (indirect) patronage of the Austrian Emperor, Joseph II, there has to be a suspicion that anti-Turkish sentiment informed the piece. Nevertheless, the opera was a success and personally very profitable for Mozart."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rice_paddies_tribal	"

Creating and maintaining a rice paddy is incredibly tiring and difficult. The flooded fields are hard to work and the water makes it impossible to use animals to lighten the load. A constant supply of water is required to keep the rice submerged and paddies are often in natural wetlands to make this process easier.

Rice was originally domesticated as far back as 3500 BC, but it only reached America in the 18th Century. It was introduced by the Spanish and proved to be a valuable product for those who learned how to grow it. Many obtained these skills from slaves they had brought from Africa."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_admiralty_european	"

Even more than an army, a fleet is a highly technical and very expensive operation. The land-bound officers of an admiralty oversee every aspect of organisation, making sure that sea-going captains want for nothing when they finally engage the enemy. A dockyard is useless unless someone has organised the supply of timber; the timber remains stacked on the wharf until someone approves the naval architect’s plans; a completed ship is useless without officers and men; and the crew expects to eat, be paid and receive prize money. All of these tasks require clerks, secretaries and experienced admirals to keep the inevitable paperwork in order and thus the machinery of a navy working.



Historically, the head of the admiralty could expect to have a senior position in government and untrammelled access to his monarch or president. He was often spending a significant portion of the national wealth: navies and their dockyards were some of the biggest “industrial” enterprises in the world during the 18th Century. A powerful and effective navy guaranteed that trade could continue, unimpeded by nefarious foreigners!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_great_museum_european	"

Some objects in the collection are the spoils of war, gifts from travellers, the items collected on the whims of past rulers, and intriguing curios from around the world. This is, in many ways, the national equivalent of a savant’s “cabinet of curiosities”: a miscellany of interesting things, collected simply because they were interesting. The other half of the collection is a clear demonstration of national prowess in all fields, be that a piece of intricate machinery, a work of superlative craftsmanship, the largest cannon in the world, and so on. It is understandable if a certain chauvinism creeps into the enterprise: it is an exercise in national trumpet-blowing!

Historically, private museums and displays had developed from the collections in “cabinets of curiosities”, and some of these had ended up as government or royal property. The world-famous British Museum began in just this way, when Sir Hans Sloane’s collection was left to George II so that it could be preserved for the nation. Now a wonderful collection of antiquities, the Museum was intended to be a universal collection, and had natural history, geology, and science exhibits."	false

start_pos_factions_description_482602603	The Pueblo Nations take their name from the Spanish word for the clay and earth settlements they live in: “pueblo” means “village”. Since the Spanish arrived in North America, the Pueblo have suffered greatly at their hands: Spanish massacres and forced conversion to Catholicism caused an uprising in 1680, and the eventual expulsion of Spain from the region for 12 years. During this time the natives were able to breed the horses left behind by the Spanish and develop impressive equestrian skills. By the time the campaign begins, the situation for the Pueblo is almost as bad as it was one hundred years earlier. Spain have reasserted their oppressive ways, but at least the Pueblo Nations can now fight back. By combining their irregular tactics with European ideas and weapons, it is possible the Pueblo could drive Spain out of America for good.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_lancers	"

The lance is probably the oldest cavalry weapon. It gives the user a chance to put all the momentum of himself and his charging horse into one very sharp point that can, in the hands of a skilled man, be driven right through any man. This is what makes lances so intimidating to face but, if the lancer does not kill his target, he is then vulnerable. A long lance is a good deal less use in a melee than a sword, and a lancer is at a disadvantage once the close fighting starts.

Historically, many nations used lancers, although the European fashion for them owes much to the uhlans: cavalry raised for Austrian and Prussian service. The French adopted lancers with some enthusiasm, and Napoleon even included Polish lancers in his Imperial Guard. In India the lance had long been used as a weapon, and lancer skills were often improved by “pegging” (picking tent pegs out of the ground with the lance tip) or pig-sticking (hunting wild pigs or even wild dogs with the lance). Native Indian lancers were rightly feared by European troops."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_rangers	"

Rangers are used for scouting and raiding missions far beyond the skills of ordinary men. Their ranks are mostly drawn from frontiersmen already hardened to living in the wilderness, as their experience making them ideal for further training. The wild nature of their environment is reflected in the unconventional tactics they are taught, and they are given some leeway where formal army discipline is concerned.

Historically, rangers were employed by the British army and were used in the hostile environments of North America during the French and Indian War. They would carry out long distance winter raids using crude snowshoes to travel. The most famous and revered of all rangers were the “Rogers’ Rangers”, named for their commanding officer, Robert Rogers. The traditions of Rogers’ Rangers are carried on today by the US Army Rangers, although the modern unit owes its existence to the Second World War experience of US troops fighting alongside British commandos and a reformed force in the Korean War."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_horse_guards	"

It is the task of the heavy cavalry to break the enemy by shock. Simply put, the Horse Guards are expected to charge home and smash enemy ranks by weight and speed. They are not for chasing down enemies: this is the work of light cavalry forces. Instead, they are a battering ram, hurled over short distances against close-formed enemies in the hope of producing a breakthrough and further confusion. These highly trained cavalrymen lend a further touch of class, thanks to the role as part of the royal household guard, to the brutal business of a cavalry charge.

Historically, the Horse Guards remain a feature of the British Army although they now use tanks. Their name is attached to Horse Guards and Horse Guards Parade. This building complex was designed by William Kent and completed in 1755 and are still used by the Household Cavalry. Horse Guards Parade is the setting for ”Trooping of the Colour”, a practice that dates back to the 17th Century. A regiment’s colours (or flags) were a rallying point in battle and so they were shown to the soldiers so they would be recognised in battle. Today, the ceremony is used to celebrate the official birthday of the ruling monarch; at the time of writing Queen Elizabeth attends every year and takes the salute at the end of the parade."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rice_farming_commune_european	"

The key, of course, to all large estates is the profit to be made by the owners and a general increase in trade beyond immediate markets. Plantations are hacked out of the surrounding forests and land made productive if there is a home market to be satisfied. Foodstuffs always find a ready market, and rice is an easy commodity to ship without too much spoilage.

Historically, rice growing eventually became an important part of the economy in colonial Georgia and Carolina and, in turn, had a direct impact on the already-thriving slave trade. Slaves from rice-growing areas of Africa attracted a premium price because they were more useful to plantation owners, and this naturally influenced where slave traders procured their unfortunate wares. Knowledgeable Africans were victimised by the trade and shipped to America precisely because of their skills; a strong back was always useful, but a skilled labourer was much more useful – and profitable."	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_company_cavalry	"

The officers and men in these units are Europeans, not locals, even though these regiments are raised in India. They are supposedly more reliable than native levies when defending European interests.

Company cavalry are equipped in European rather than Indian fashion; they fight as light, sabre-armed cavalry. Their tasks include acting as scouts, screening the main body of an army, and pursuing fleeing enemies – taking a sabre to someone already running away is likely to keep him running! It is not their main job to break enemy units or to fight other cavalry.

By 1700, the great European trading companies were so huge they could afford armies of their own, separate from the national army. The British East India Company, the Dutch “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” (VOC) and the French “La Compagnie française des Indes orientales” all had armies, fleets and forts in India and the far east. The Dutch felt it profitable to have one fifth of their employees in uniform, and the other companies were not far behind."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_steam-pumped_gold_mine_european	"

Pumping or lifting the water allows the miners to reach richer, deeper mineral seams. A steam beam engine, linked to a pump, can lift enough water to make it economically sensible to dig deep shafts. 

Historically, Thomas Newcomen was the first to develop a practical “atmospheric” engine for draining deep mines sometime around 1710. His design had problems and was very inefficient, but it worked well enough to be widely adopted where coal was cheap. It was an atmospheric engine because the steam was never under pressure, and relied on a partial vacuum forming when the steam cooled, thus sucking the piston down the cylinder. The need to repeatedly warm and then cool the machine made it wasteful. 

James Watt’s beam engine design was altogether more efficient. He had a separate steam condenser, and kept the cylinder at a constant temperature. He was also lucky in his choice of working partner, Matthew Boulton, who proved to be an astute business manager and lobbyist: he even persuaded the British Parliament to extend their patent, guaranteeing them further profit!"	false

It is a truism that soldiers have little time for the bureaucrats who send them their orders. Some organisation above the level of a regiment is, however, a necessary evil: supplies must be purchased and distributed, transport organised, officers’ promotion lists kept in order, and generals given their orders. All this means paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork! Money, and the power to spend it, are vitally important and all government secretariats are keen to hold on to both.

Historically, the government departments that ran armies in the 18th Century were far from being defence ministries or anything approaching a general staff. A central war planning function was almost unheard of, and often generals were quite unwilling to deal with the authorities at home, preferring to control everything themselves. In Europe the army organisations dealt with pay and rations: often spending time making sure that colonels did really raise regiments they were being paid for! The Ottomans were much more organised, and their armies were on a professional footing and raised on a national basis, even if some of the units raised were rather old fashioned."	false

Meeting halls were decorated with beautiful depictions of tribal history, the spirits and important animals. Some tribes also practiced sand painting, although this was used as a healing ritual. The sand images varied according to the sickness to be cured, and the beauty of the work affected the success of the healing."	false

Drink is one of the solace’s of a long working day. There are, of course, religious and social taboos about getting drunk, but these rarely bother tavern owners or their customers! A tavern provides a place to drink cheaply, pick up the local news, gossip, gamble (cockfighting is a popular pastime) and generally have a few hours respite from the day’s labour. It is often the “other” centre of a community, where the real business of running a town goes on, well away from official interference.

A tavern is distinguished from an inn because it does not offer overnight accommodation, although rooms for private functions – and discreet entertainment of an intimate or personal nature – may well be part of the service."	false

The president is expected to live in some style, yet retain his accessibility as the elected leader. Like many royal palaces, a president’s home is home to a working bureaucracy, keeping the affairs of the nation in order. 

Republics often hark back to the Classical themes of their culture: European republics hark back to Roman architecture for its grandeur, monumental scale and implied permanence. Other cultures have a similar tendency to appropriate the dignity of the past for their political buildings. 

Historically, and despite many egalitarian protests, most presidential residences are palatial in luxury if not in size. Most presidents are from the moneyed classes, after all, and are used to their creature comforts. Of course, a republic does not imply any kind of equality, merely that “the people” have the greatest say in government; the ruling classes still exist and still expect their perquisites. Purpose-built presidential palaces are usually grander, as an exercise in overawing visiting foreign dignitaries with the power and prestige of the nation itself and the office of president (if not always the prestige of the current holder of the office)."	false

events_event_text_decline_and_fall_roman_empire	"The eminent historian and sometime member of parliament Edward Gibbon has published ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"", truly his magnum opus - and the fruit of seven long years of work. The book - the first of six planned volumes - deals with the slow disintegration of the Roman Empire from 180 A.D. until 1590 A.D.

Having sold out already, the success of the first volume can be put down partly due to Gibbon’s very readable style of writing, but also that his arguments are always supported by solid reference to primary sources, notes indicating his own thought processes, and always an objective eye. Gibbon paints a picture of an empire which grew soft, self-absorbed and self-indulgent over the course of fifteen hundred years. Rome, he argues, wallowed in the material wealth secured by their forebears, was comforted by the salvation offered by their newfound Christianity and the illusory strength of the hired barbarian mercenaries in the guarding of its borders.

Some readers are struck by the parallels between Gibbon’s depiction of the decline of the seemingly all-powerful Roman Empire and the similarities with the ebb and flow of the world in these supposedly more enlightened times!"	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_empiricism	"

As men seek to explain the world around them, and their place within it, new theories are formulated almost weekly and one such theory is empiricism. Empiricists believe that the human mind is a tabula rasa (white paper), and our experiences as we grow and learn make a mark on this paper. It is through these marks that we identify with things and understand them.

The work of philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) was the driving force behind the inception of empiricism. He redefined the tabula rasa argument, first worked on by Ibn Tufail in the 12th century. His key works explored the human mind and often clashed with other theorists of his time. The rationalists, for example, held the human mind to be capable of comprehending some things without need of the senses, through faith. Locke, on the other hand, believed the mind was only capable of comprehending things through experience"	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_explosive_shells	"

Cannonballs are usually exactly that: solid lumps of iron (or stone, for some early weapons) that do damage on impact. They must hit the target to have an effect. Explosive shells, however, are cunningly contrived to explode after a set time, causing damage and injury to everything within the blast. A cast iron sphere contains gunpowder; a lit fuse burns down at a set rate until the bursting charge is reached. The skill of the gunner is in judging the trajectory of the shot and the length of fuse required to explode the shell over or amongst the enemy.

Historically the weapons used for shells were most often short-barrelled mortars or howitzers. Apart from anything else, the gunner had to reach down the barrel to ignite the shell fuse, and then get out of the way before the piece fired or the shell exploded. It was not unknown for gunners to be killed by premature shell bursts, either in the barrel or shortly after firing! The explosive shell lives on today in the form of cartoon bombs with the word “BOMB” on the side in large, unfriendly letters."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_eua_select_marksmen	"

Rangers are used for scouting and raiding missions far beyond the skills of ordinary men. Their ranks are mostly drawn from frontiersmen already hardened to living in the wilderness and capable of hiding in a variety of terrain types. Excellent marksmen, they excel at ranged combat but suffer in prolonged melee attacks. They are trained to conceal themselves and fight in loose formation, but if caught in the open by line infantry or cavalry they are likely to sustain heavy casualties.

Historically, Fraser’s Rangers was a British brigade formed in Canada and composed of General Fraser’s 24th Regiment of Foot, with light infantry and grenadier units from Sir Guy Carleton’s Montreal force. These men took part in a number of key battles during the American Revolution, most notably the Battle of Bennington where they sustained heavy losses. They also fought at Saratoga, where they came up against Major General Morgan and his 500 elite riflemen. Morgan’s men were attacked by the British advanced company, but Fraser and his rangers drove them back, allowing the advanced company to retreat."	false

Along with an accomplice, who has escaped justice, MacLaine committed over twenty robberies over a six month period, culminating in his arrest when he attempted to sell on lace stripped from a waistcoat back to the tailor who made it. Upon searching his dwellings the constable found that ""there were a wardrobe of clothes, three-and-twenty purses, and the celebrated blunderbuss found at his lodgings, besides a famous kept mistress"".

MacLaine’s trial at the Old Bailey attracted many from respectable society, as well as almost three thousand visitors during his stay at Newgate. His subsequent date at Tyburn was well attended, the writer Soame Jenyns noting that ""some of the brightest eyes were at this time in tears for one 'McLean', condemned for robbery on the highway""."	false

Consisting of a group of remarkable polymaths covering all manner of technical and theoretical disciplines, the Lunar Society are second in stature only to the Royal Society, and see themselves as a revolutionary committee for the industrial age. They postulate radical scientific ideas, and debate them for hours in a civilised manner over a decent meal, with a view to changing and improving the world for all, forever.

One of the recurring themes of Lunar Society discussions is how to efficiently increase production capacity, as the members believe that an increase in that area would assist in achieving ""material decency for all"" in a Britain that currently boasts a grossly unfair distribution of wealth. These are radical ideas indeed within the current social order, and they may yet take hundreds of years to fully realise."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_mortar_ship_design	"

Mortars fire explosive shells, and these can have a devastating effect on wooden vessels. However, because of their high, plunging trajectories, mortar shells cannot be easily fired from conventional ships: the rigging and sails get in the way. This means that a new design, incorporating a reinforced firing platform and repositioned masts to give a clear field of fire, is required.

Historically, the bomb ketch was a French innovation although it was rapidly copied by other naval powers. The original design had two, relatively small, mortars either side of the centre line, and was rigged as a two-masted ketch. This made the ships awkward sailors and later designs opted for a three-masted arrangement, with only one large mortar. The rigging ""ropes"" of the front mast were changed for forged chains; these would be flame proof and could not be set alight by the muzzle blast from the mortar. The ships were extremely strong, and were used for naval expeditions in Polar waters, where crushing ice sheets were a hazard."	false

Like their predecessors the ""Muns"", ""Hectors"", ""Scourers"" and ""Nickers"", this gang of vicious ruffians - known as the ""Young Bloods"" or ""Mohocks"" (a crude interpretation of the Native American Mohawk tribe) is running amok in the streets, attacking both men and women with acts of indiscriminate and brutal violence. Unusually in this case, men are being attacked with knives - sometimes losing fingers, hands or noses - whereas women are being sexually assaulted, but no one is being robbed in the process.

It is possible by their methods that the Mohocks are wealthy young gentlemen with no need to steal, but with the insatiable thirst for the excitement of violence. The authorities have rightly fixed a bounty of one hundred pounds for the gang’s capture."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_poland_lazienki_park	"

The Park and its gardens were acquired by Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last King and Grand Duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, after his election. Although already impressive, he set about remodelling them, and made the gardens his life’s work, building his “Palace on the Water” in a suitably magnificent setting by the Lake. This watery connection was how the park got its name of Lazienki or “Royal Baths” Park, after the bathing pavilion that was constructed in the gardens.

The garden was also a magnificent setting for Stanislaw’s regular dinner parties with leading artists, writers and politicians. While Stanislaw was something of an autocrat, he was also a believer in education and the ideas of the Enlightenment, using the dinners to engage with leading thinkers.

The park and palaces were lucky to survive the Warsaw Rising in 1944. They were mined for destruction, but the German occupiers never completed their demolition works, although the Lazienki Palace was burned."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_2nd_hussars	"

Hussar duties include patrolling, gathering of information and denying the enemy the freedom to do the same. They also provide the valuable service of pursuing routing enemies, and their speed makes them a useful reserve to attack any enemy unit that is about to break. Bringing about such a crisis can make the difference between victory and defeat.

Historically, hussars in Prussian service were not large men, with a maximum height of 1.67 metres, possibly the result of their largely peasant upbringing; their horses were proportionally small. Their commanding officers were, however, under no such restrictions and were drawn from among the Prussian Junkers. General Hans Joachim von Ziethen started as an infantry officer, but transferred to the dragoons when his commander took a dislike to his “squeaky voice and mean, insignificant appearance”. Possibly because of these personal qualities he developed a reputation as a duellist and dissenter. This aggressive attitude served him well when he transferred to the 2nd Hussars and he was given command. He remained with the regiment for 45 years, even after promotion to general’s rank, until his death at 87."	false

No one can afford to ignore a plentiful food supply, even if gathering it means braving the ocean swell. Sea fishery is a risky undertaking, but one that can feed many. The spearing skills and equipment used by each man are the same as for freshwater fish. Once taken, fish can be smoked or salted to last the long winter months.

Historically the North American tribes did not really have the sailing technology to exploit the vast stocks of sea fish that were to be found off the coast. However, given that the potential of this food source was demonstrated by the Europeans, it is likely they would have exploited it given the chance."	false

Men working in a copper mine recently entered a long disused tunnel and found a body now proved to be that of Fet-Mals Israelsson, a miner who disappeared 42 years previous. When the body was brought to the surface, it turned as hard as rock. Notwithstanding the fact that his former fiancée still lives, the apparently petrified body has been put on display as a curiosity.

Having seen the corpse, the renowned naturalist Carl Linne has suggested that Israelsson’s body has in fact been covered and preserved in Oil of Vitriol. Since the oil is now slowly evaporating due to contact with outside air, inevitable putrefaction will now set in - there being some early signs of this already. Until this happens, the unfortunate Israelsson’s body remains on display - despite calls for his immediate burial."	false

In 1706 he was leading the Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands against the French and Bavarian forces in the War of Spanish Succession. Two years before he had won a great victory at Blenheim.

Churchill did not expect the French to attack in Flanders, but Louis XIV had ordered Marshal Villeroi to do just that. After French success in Italy and along the Rhine, Louis wanted to see similar victories in Flanders. Villeroi therefore set out to bring Marlborough to battle, and Marlborough moved to meet this French offensive. Both sides moved quicker than the other expected, and they met at the town of Ramillies. Villeroi deployed with his line centred on Ramillies, and Marlborough prepared his forces for attack.

Lead Marlborough’s army in its assault on Villeroi’s positions.

Historically Marlborough won his second great victory of the war at Ramillies thanks to his subtle tactical manoeuvring. The victory destroyed Villeroi’s army. Marlborough would go on to win two more great victories in the war at Oudenaarde and Malplaquet."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_rocket_ship	"

A rocket ship is intended to plaster a large area with a huge number of rocket projectiles in a very short time. The need for a large deck space to be clear for the rockets’ launch troughs compromises the ship’s handling and sailing qualities, but this is a small price to pay for horrendous and terrifying firepower! There is also the danger to the crew: the risk of explosion is enough to age any captain prematurely, and rigging chains (not ropes) and wetted sails are standard features.

Military rockets are the result of European troops getting some very nasty surprises when campaigning in India (Congreve’s rocket system was designed to copy Indian weapons). The large variety of warheads, including explosive shells, makes rockets a versatile but often inaccurate weapon. The best way of using rockets is en masse: the more fired at a single target, the better, given that some are almost inevitably going to fly astray – not that this inaccuracy matters to those on the receiving end!

Historically, the Royal Navy used rockets to bombard ports and enemy fortifications. The phrase “the rockets’ red glare” in the US national anthem commemorates the use of Congreve rockets against Fort McHenry, which guarded the harbour entrance at Baltimore, Maryland, during the War of 1812"	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_shortened_carbines	"

The carbine fires a lighter ball than an infantry musket: a pound of lead can make 15-17 rounds. Being handmade, these balls often have bubbles and other flaws in them, and can burst apart after hitting flesh, making far larger wounds than their apparent size would indicate.

Originally, a carbine had the same length barrel as an infantry musket. This made reloading while mounted rather difficult, and it was realised that cutting down the barrel would make for a handier weapon with only a small decrease in accuracy and killing power.

The term “carbine” is still in use: at the time of writing, the M4 carbine carried by modern US soldiers is a development of the M16, itself a shortened form of the AR-15 rifle designed in the late 1950s. The number of spherical bullets made from a pound of lead is also used today as a way of indicating the bore of shotguns: a 12-bore would fire a solid lead ball weighing around 1/12 of a pound."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_basic	"

Constructing roads allows local goods to reach nearby markets, and gives some useful work to paupers and work-shy individuals who would otherwise be moved on or require expensive charity. At the very least, the larger rocks have been moved out of the road, pounded to pieces and the resulting rubble used as a roadbed. Drainage ditches mean the road ceases to be a convenient gutter for rainwater, and a muddy hell for anyone trying to use it.

Historically, there was often a military imperative for building roads. Troops and artillery require good roads for strategic redeployments and rapid reaction. In Scotland, General Wade completed a network of roads to “Roman” standards during the 1720s so that armies could quickly move into the rebellious Highlands – the Jacobite supporters of the ousted Stuart dynasty were a constant threat. His achievement was celebrated in a (now defunct) verse of the then-new British anthem:

Lord, grant that Marshal Wade
May, by thy mighty aid,
Victory bring.
May he sedition hush
And, like a torrent, rush
Rebellious Scots to crush.
God save the King."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_royal_academy_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	"

Academies concern themselves with all aspects of national cultural and scientific life. From the most abstract of mathematical conundrums to the collections of natural wonders and the study of languages and lexicography, nothing is outside the interests of academicians. The members are, by and large, selected by their peers, although individual governments do use their influence to secure places for worthy men – and these learned societies are not above granting membership to royalty in the hope of securing patronage!

Large projects were matters of national prestige. The Académie française, was charged with the collation of an official French dictionary. The epic voyage of Captain Cook, RN, in 1768–71 was partly influenced by the desire of the British Royal Society to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun from Tahiti. Other nations sent observers to, among other places, Canada and Siberia – Cook got the nicest destination! By observing the event from different sides of the Earth, parallax made it possible to calculate the size of the solar system and establish the astronomical unit."	false

Like many aspects of the Native American way of life, fishing is dependent upon the seasons. Ice fishing in winter is a cold, lonely and slow business compared to using nets and lures in spring. The arrival of fish off the coast and in rivers is also tied to the passing seasons.

Fish often play a key part in mythology, none more than the salmon. One tale tells of a salmon becoming involved in a contest for a chief’s daughter. The contest saw the salmon break a set of elk antlers into pieces to win the hand of the young maiden."	false

A man’s skill and courage is not only forged in battle, but also through competition on the games field. Taking part means warriors have to pit their wits against more evenly matched opponents. Sports also improve a village’s morale: fun is a welcome change from the work of the day.

Historically, many of the native tribes played ‘the ball game’ which bore many similarities to lacrosse. Teams of ten or more men represented their village or tribe, and each player carried two small sticks, not the rackets now used in lacrosse. The object of the game was to drive the ball through the opposing team’s goal; the goals were about 150 yards or metres apart. The ball game was incredibly rough and fiercely competitive, a bloodsport in all but name."	false

Lawmakers should meet in awe-inspiring and magnificent buildings, because then there is a chance that they will take the business of making new law seriously. If something cannot be built for the purpose, then taking the extremely expensive home of a “dashed aristo” will do quite nicely!

Historically, the Palais Bourbon was built as a home for Louise-Françoise, duchesse de Bourbon, one Louis XIV’s legitimised bastards by one of his favourite mistresses, Françoise-Athénaïs de Montespan. The building, although rather magnificent and scarcely a hovel, was not technically a palace, because Louise-Françoise herself did not have royal rank. After the French Revolution, it was nationalised and used as a meeting place of the Council of Five Hundred. It is still a parliament building, now acting as home to the deputies of the French National Assembly, the lower legislative house of the French Republic. Louise-Françoise probably wouldn’t recognise her old home, as it has been extensively remodelled."	false

events_event_text_russia_julian	"Though to many observers time in Russia passes slowly, this year it has actually contrived to go backwards by over five and a half thousand years! For time out of mind, Russia has used an ""Anno Mundi"" calendar based on the creation of the world - as pinpointed most accurately by Panodorus of Alexandria, in antiquity. This calendar puts New Year’s Day on 1st September and holds the current year to be 7208.

However, the Tsar has recently returned from an embassy to Europe and decreed that Russia shall henceforth adopt the Julian calendar in use there. The Julian calendar is a Roman system modelled on the tropical year, beginning on January 1st and lasting 365 days - with an extra day every fourth or ""leap"" year. In addition, the numbering of years has also been changed to the Anno Domini system - beginning from the accepted birth year of Christ.

With Russia’s prestige rising as her stature among her western allies grows, the Tsar is doing away with the complexities of converting between calendars that previously led to embarrassment on the battlefield where allies would turn up to fight weeks apart, believing they were to converge on the same date.

Whereas the Tsar has made the change an official mandate across the empire, it has not yet been acknowledged by the clerics of the Orthodox faith, who continue to use the original system."	false

events_event_text_new_britain_discovered	"Captain William Dampier of HMS Roebuck has returned from a voyage of exploration in the southern latitudes, where he has been engaged in mapping several coastlines around New South Wales and the former Spanish possession of Nova Guinea.

As an experienced seaman, having circumnavigated the world during his time as a buccaneer, he found himself marooned with a shipmate on a South Sea island and escaped by building a raft - eventually returning to England with nothing but the clothes he wore and his journals.

Dampier successfully published his journals as ""New Voyage Around the World"", which caught the attention of the Admiralty. They engaged his services as commander of the Roebuck exploration expedition. After successfully charting several coastlines and discovering an island now named ""Nova Britannia"" - or ""New Britain"" -  the Roebuck eventually bore up for home, unfortunately foundering on Ascension Island. Fortunately Dampier and the surviving crew were soon picked up by a passing East India Company vessel.

Upon returning to Britain, Dampier's discoveries have been marred by accusations of brutality - a crew member imprisoned in Brazil returned before Dampier and blackened his name with the Admiralty. Despite protestations, Dampier has been court-martialled and stripped of his position and pay for the entire voyage. Undeterred, he has since published an account of this second circumnavigation and is actively contemplating a return to his previous buccaneering lifestyle."	false

Parliamentary government involves the elected representatives of the people forming a government with the monarch’s consent – although the ministers who emerge from the system may not be entirely to the monarch’s taste! While the sovereign can at least have an advisory role, and choose chief ministers, those ministers determine national policy. Unless a ministry can command majority support in parliament, its policies, of left or right, radical or conservative, will fail.

The terms “left” and “right” to define political views in an elected system come from just before the violent birth of the French Republic, when the absolutist Louis XVI was moving towards a constitutional monarchy. The liberal deputies of the “Third Estate” in the “Estates General” (a parliament called by Louis) sat to the left of the assembly president’s chair, while the nobility (the “Second Estate”) with more conservative views sat on his right. The terms “left” and “right” have continued to this day, usually in a disapproving fashion. Louis’ success with his constitutional experiments was limited: the guillotine ended his reign in a sudden and cravat-ruining fashion!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_republican_conscript_infantry	"

Conscripts are usually given basic training of a kind; a measure of drill instruction and enough knowledge of their weapons so that they are less danger to themselves than the enemy. However, it is often impossible to instil military skills and virtues in men who do not want to be in the army, and for this reason their grasp of even elementary tactics may be scant. This can cost lives in battle, as the use of conscripts is to march them towards the enemy en masse, and hope that the enemy cannot kill them all.

Conscription is an easy method of recruiting troops, by simply compelling the adult male population to join the army for a set period or until an emergency ends. Usually, there are enough special exemptions so that the moneyed classes do not have to join the ranks. Conscription is not without its costs: as men are swept into the ranks, the supply of labourers and even skilled workers can vanish almost overnight."	false

The janissaries are the “yeni cheri” (literally the “new soldiers”) although they are the earliest organised, regularly paid, state army in existence in Europe. Recruited as child soldiers from among the non-Muslims of the Ottoman world, indoctrination produces superb warriors and unquestioningly loyal state functionaries. 

The long, proud and bloody tradition of janissary victory and excessive zeal was a result and a cause of an almost-monastic training regime. This tradition as a “warrior order” influenced in turn the ascetic architectural style of their barracks. That, at least, is the theory. Lacking local loyalties, and having had their family ties broken, they became the “enforcers of empire” as well as its defenders because they had no reason to be sympathetic towards anyone not in their ranks.

Historically, however, the janissaries did not remain elite warriors and nothing else. They extended their reach into all aspects of the state bureaucracy, practiced a variety of trades and professions in addition to soldiering, and often lived a less-than-celibate lifestyle. They also became conservative in outlook and a real obstacle to any kind of political, military or social reform."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_expat_infantry	"

Europe is awash with exiles, the dispossessed that have taken up arms thanks to war, religious persecution and politics. Some fight to free their homelands and some because home is gone. A few fight for the romance of it all, and for glory and riches. All serve because it is a better choice than starving. Whatever their motives, expatriates are a useful source of men. If someone can carry a musket, there is a place in the ranks. There is always the suspicion that individuals who have turned their coats once may do so again, even though this is unfair to many. As a result, it is unusual for expatriates to serve under their own officers.

Despite the fact that many in the ranks are intelligent enough to act as skirmishers, expatriate infantry carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets and usually fight as line infantry. It is easier to maintain discipline in such units.

Historically, expatriate infantry varied in quality. The Irish Catholic “Wild Geese” in French service fought well, especially against the English. The French Royalist “Chasseurs Britaniques” in the British army, did not relish battle and often deserted at the first opportunity."	false

No true warrior willingly runs from a fight. A man’s worth in tribal society is often measured by his skill as a warrior and war leader. Fighting for the Europeans gives a man many chances to go into battle, earn honour and gain in skill and reputation. The chance to fight traditional tribal enemies is also welcome.

Historically, European settlers had few qualms about exploiting the warlike nature of some native peoples of the New World. It was far better to have a “noble savage” at your side than facing you in battle."	false

events_event_text_trippy_dreams	"Doctor Thomas ""Quicksilver"" Dover has had an interesting life. Beginning his career as a doctor in Bristol, he invested in shipping and privateering in the Caribbean, undertook a stint as ship’s surgeon, became captain of a slaver, fell foul of the East India Company’s thirst for revenue, and eventually became involved in the ill-fated South Sea Company at Buenos Aires - as one does.

Having found himself back in England and virtually bankrupt, Dover has since returned to the practice for which he was educated, at Cecil Street on The Strand, proving to be a fine doctor. Now at the age of seventy, Dr Dover has attracted a fine roster of patients by the publishing of his ""Ancient Physician’s Legacy"", a guide to medical matters designed for reference in the home. Included in it is his recipe for what is now known as ""Dover’s Powder"" - a mix of Ipecac, Opium, Saltpeter, Tartare and Liquorice.

The powder works by inducing sweats to moderate temperature and regulate fever, as well as killing pain. As such, ""Dover’s Powder"" has found use in the Army and Navy, where it already benefits the sick and wounded."	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_percussion_shells	"

Explosive shells usually rely on the gunner lighting a separate fuse on the shell itself prior to the gun being fired. The fuse burns at a set rate, and explodes after a selected time regardless of whether or not a target has been hit or the enemy is nearby. Incorrectly set fuses can kill friends or gunners, or not explode at all. Explosive shells are also limited to mortars and howitzers which lob their projectiles in a high arc.

The percussion shell, however, is cunningly fashioned to take advantage of the explosive properties of fulminating compounds. These chemicals burst into flame when struck, and this can be used to ignite larger charges of gunpowder. The shock of an impact on a target is transferred to the fulminate, which then ignites the shell’s bursting charge. Such shells can be fired from ordinary cannons, directly at an enemy.

Historically, the work of Henri-Joseph Paixhans (1783-1854), who combined the flat-firing cannon and a reliable percussion shell, lead directly to the obsolescence of the wooden warship and the rise of the ironclad."	false

It is anticipated that when completed, the work will extend to some 40 volumes, complete with numerous copperplate engravings and illustrations. Detailed within are an incredible wealth of ancient paintings, bronzes, lamps, lanterns, candelabra, sculptures and other antiquities so far recovered.

Though the original work was not intended for general publication, such is the level of interest that pamphlets and books of excerpts have already appeared, and the beauty of the objects is already influencing tastes in design."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_line_infantry	"

“Marching regiments” or “line battalions” make up the majority of units in European-style armies. They are so called because they form the line of battle, not because they always deploy in lines. Indeed, over time the capabilities of line infantry should improve as new tactics, drill and weaponry are developed.

These soldiers carry muzzle-loading, smoothbore muskets firing lead balls as wide as a man’s thumb. These are inaccurate weapons, effective only over 200 paces or so and when fired in massed volleys. The ability to fire and reload with machine-like regularity with shot and bullet flying and comrades falling all around is what wins battles.

Historically, in many armies colonels received a fee to raise regiments, which remained their personal property and commands. They jealously guarded their rights to appoint friends, relatives and hangers-on as regimental officers. This contractor system, however, allowed unscrupulous officers to make handsome profits by pocketing the pay of non-existent soldiers. The better colonels did take a pride in their regiments, spending their own fortunes on good uniforms and weapons. The capabilities of a “standard” line infantry unit therefore varied between nations and over time. It wasn’t until the 1760s that anything approaching uniformity of drill, equipment and regulations became the norm.

Line infantry regiments remained unchanged throughout the period, and their organisational pattern still forms the basis of modern military units."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_haydut_irregulars	"

This is because they are bandits. They carry muskets, and have the skills to use them extremely accurately compared to other musket-armed troops. Haydut irregulars are extremely good at using ground cover, and can hide in almost any terrain, again as might be expected of brigands or bandits. They are, however, not suited to combat against cavalrymen, as they have no formal military training. They do not wear armour, as this would slow them down if they needed to run away!

In the Balkans a haydut (the Turkish version of the word) or hajduk, was a Muslim or Christian bandit, but one who stole mostly from the Ottoman overlords, led his fellows in fighting injustice, and robbed the rich to give to the poor. All this is very romantic, but not entirely inaccurate. The hayduts were bandits, but they did not always fight against the Ottomans. For the right money, they could also be persuaded to fight for the Sultan. Like bandits everywhere, their equipment and uniforms were taken from their victims, so it was not uncommon to see hayduts using Austrian as well as Turkish war gear."	false

battles_description_battle_of_brandywine_creek	"After landing from his transport ships on the American coast, Major-General Sir William Howe led the British troops eastwards, with the intention of capturing Philadelphia.

In preparation, American General George Washington readied most of his units to defend from this frontal assault around the narrow crossing of Chad's Ford on the Brandywine. The Creek flows through the countryside of Pennsylvania, enveloped by sheer cliffs and heavily wooded hills on both sides. Knowing that much of fast-flowing creek could not be crossed, Washington was confident of holding his position.

However, more detailed surveillance of the terrain would suggest that alternative routes could turn the battle in the favour of the British."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_sheet_lead_cartridges	"

Powder is traditionally kept in the magazine deep in the bowels of the ship, carefully isolated from any stray sparks or naked flames. Traditionally, when going into action, the master gunner had his crews prepare small bags, each containing the right amount of powder for a given weight of cannon. These bags were then distributed to the gun captains, making loading a quicker and safer process.

However, cloth bags will get wet in the normal course of events aboard ship, or sparks falling on them can cause explosions. This has brought about the development of other containers for gunpowder charges. The most successful in experiments are cylinder-shaped cartridges made of soft sheet lead, which can be filled with powder and then carefully bent closed by hand. These can be prepared before battle, and are largely immune to both sparks and damp. The whole lead cylinder is rammed into the barrel, followed by a shot. A sharp spike rammed into the touchhole pierces the cartridge, allowing the primer to fire the main shot. The result is a reliable and safe loading procedure."	false

Written from a High Tory perspective and demanding the extermination of all religious dissenters - of which Defoe is one - the work is clearly a satire, intended to lampoon and undermine those persons in positions of authority. As such it was judged as libel likely to foster sedition, and Defoe sentenced to three days in the pillory as punishment. Quickly publishing his ""Hymn to the Pillory"", Defoe avoided a potentially life-threatening experience and was instead pelted with nothing more injurious than flowers. The usually bloodthirsty mob also read extracts of his other literary works aloud.

Further rumours hold that since then, whilst incarcerated in a Newgate cell, Defoe has met with a government representative, and that intelligence work was the subject of their conversation."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_plug_bayonet	"

At one time “marching regiments” were composed of musketeers and pikemen. The pikes provided protection for the musketeers while they slowly reloaded and in the event of a cavalry attack. In a melee the musketeers reversed their guns and used them as clubs, or dropped them and drew swords. Neither solution was ideal, and equipping half a unit with pikes also halved its potential firepower. As muskets became lighter and no longer needed a firing rest, it became practical to attach a blade to the muzzle, giving the user a better-than-makeshift weapon in melee.

Ramming a blade, hilt first, into the muzzle is a practical solution. The soldier then has a short pike to fend off cavalry, and use in hand-to-hand combat. The drawbacks are that it is often difficult to remove the plug bayonet once used in anger and resume firing, the user cannot reload – and only a fool fires a gun when the barrel is blocked!

Historically, muskets with plug bayonets were the equivalent of short pikes, and old-fashioned pike drill applied: men advanced with their muskets held shoulder high, and levelled at the enemy."	false

While the Academy was a pet project of Prince Frederick III, the Elector of Brandenburg, he did not fund it from royal or state treasuries. Instead, he rather cleverly granted the academy a monopoly on producing and selling calendars in his domain, giving it a steady, but not substantial, income. When Frederick was crowned as “King in Prussia”, the Academy was granted royal patronage.

Under Frederick the Great, a man normally regarded as a warrior-king, the academy merged with Prussian Nouvelle Société Littéraire (French being a primary language of literature and culture in the 18th Century) and the Royal Academy of Sciences. He also offered cash prizes as incentives to the members to investigate and solve the scientific conundrums of the day. The Academy had its own laboratories, an observatory, libraries, an operating theatre (for public demonstrations of surgery), and gardens for plant specimens."	false

Eleven ships carrying around fifteen hundred people have finally arrived after a punishing journey of eleven months. Governor Arthur Phillip arrived ahead of the fleet and found that the bay did not live up to his expectations, there being little fresh water and poor soil.

Scouting further north along the coast they have found a more suitable site for habitation, naming it Port Jackson. The convicts have been set to work building their own dwellings and preparing the soil for agriculture."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_naval_board_european	"

More than simply organising supplies, fleet movements, promotions and pay, a naval administration also draws up plans for the future: it oversees construction of new dockyards and shore facilities, husbands scarce resources (some sea-going officers would say a little too carefully), and collects navigation charts and improved ship designs from all over the world. The navy secretariat studies anything worthwhile to make the sea service more effective or (better yet) cheaper!

As navies increased in size during the 18th Century, the support operations ashore became correspondingly large. The Royal Navy was the largest “business” in the world, employing tens of thousands of workers to produce everything needed for the fleet from ropes to nails, yards to swivel guns. The functionaries needed to oversee this enterprise had to be clever, clear thinking and reasonably honest: a man would give a lucrative contract to friends, if he could, but not if it risked the good of the Service. Other nations never really matched the efficiency of the British Royal Navy system, and their fleets at sea suffered as a result."	false

events_event_text_filth_and_naughtiness	"A curious mixture of dismay and barely-disguised exultation has greeted the announcement of Edmund Curll’s death.

Publisher Curll began his career apprenticed to a London bookseller, eventually buying the business out when his employer went bankrupt. Curll quickly put his own ideas into effect, selling cheap books for working people, and exploiting any current sensation by publishing several accounts from each and every point of view. His shop offered the widest possible range of works from religious tracts to works of ""adult interest""; politics to poetry.

During this time, Curll also developed a reputation for unscrupulous behaviour, shamelessly seeking publicity in whatever form he could get it - good or bad! Fraudulent medical texts were published, unauthorised copies of other publishers titles appeared and the work of other writers was plagiarised in the name of profit. In this latter respect, Curll made an enemy of Alexander Pope, and the two embarked upon a lifetime of mutual enmity and public rancour. In return for many pamphlets either stealing his work or blackening his name, Pope arranged an incident where Curll was wrapped in a blanket and beaten with cudgels by schoolboys; and on the occasion of a meeting between the two - ostensibly to bury the hatchet - Pope slipped his rival a substance causing Curll a protracted bout of vomiting!

Curll’s questionable publishing practices also led to his spending time in both prison and the stocks, though typically he published a broadsheet defending his position and, rather than being pelted with the customary rocks, vegetables and ordure, was instead cheered by the mob! On his release Curll carried on his work precisely as before.

His practice of fastening on the deaths of prominent people, and being the first to publish their frequently defamatory and largely fictitious biographies has led to Curll’s description as ""one of the new terrors of death"". Whereas his own death at 72 may be a source of comfort to many in the public eye, the average working man will no doubt miss Curll’s many graphic adult titles!"	false

The Amazons are denied the right to marriage once in the regiment, and religion is used to give them a sense of being sacred.

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_improved_grenades	"

Grenades are dangerous weapons to their users as well as enemies. Premature detonation is always a risk, one that will probably kill and certainly maim the grenadier and anyone else nearby. There is also the need for a grenadier to throw the grenade further than its explosive killing radius! By making the hollow case thinner and being careful with the powder composition in fuses, it is possible to make grenades slightly safer for the user.

Historically, grenadiers were the strongest and largest soldiers. It was rightly assumed that a big chap could throw a cricket ball (baseball) sized grenade at a distant enemy. The weight of a dozen grenades in a pack was not a trivial load. Flintlock grenade throwers were developed: these had very short, wide barrels and used gunpowder to launch the grenade – a man-portable mini-mortar! The need to load a musket, light a fuse and fire at an enemy promptly before the grenade exploded made them tricky (and nerve-wracking) to use."	false

In times of battle, they ask the spirits to guide and protect the tribe’s fighters, keeping them from harm, giving them true knowledge of the enemy’s strengths and guiding the aim of every man. They carry individual totems that hold great power: objects struck by lightning, or that have been in contact with the dead. This is their contribution to the safety and strength of all involved in a battle.

Historically, medicine men and shamans gave supposedly magical power to those in their tribes, but they also gave practical medical help too. They had a deep knowledge of herbs and plants, many of which could be used to heal wounds as well as treat illness."	false

All royal guards think of themselves as the elite of their national armies. Sometimes, they are court regiments where a martial appearance is valued more than real soldiering. The Blue Guards, however, have a tradition of fighting, and can shame any line regiment with their discipline and skill. This does not make them popular as they are, of course, all gentlemen and superior to any mere common infantry.

Historically, the Blue Guards began as the personal bodyguard to Protestant William of Orange (later William III of England and Scotland). They followed him as he drove out the Catholic King James II after the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688. They were at the forefront of the attack during the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690, wading across the river to fall upon James’ line. With William’s claim to the throne secure after James’ defeat, the Blue Guards remained his personal bodyguards until his death in 1702: William could not bring himself to really trust Englishmen. After his death the Blue Guards returned to the Netherlands, and resumed duties there, playing a key role in the War of Spanish Succession."	false

By making the correct offerings to the Spirit of the Forest, a tribe can establish a link with the Creator, and so gain access to more of the Earth’s bounty. Untouched woodlands and fields can yield just as much worth as worked farmland, because the spirits are at peace.

Animal spirits played a key role in tribal religious beliefs, and some were thought to have negative effects. The Apache believed that some animals contained the ghosts of witches and other restless spirits; owls, bears, snakes, and coyotes were the keepers of such ghosts. Coyotes also played the role of tricksters in Apache religion, and featured heavily in their beliefs about the world’s creation. Shamans who had power and control over coyotes were held in high regard as they had the ability to cure the illnesses that these malevolent spirits could cause."	false

Following a recent downturn in the economic fortunes of his home city of Venice - where especially Baroque music has not oft been commissioned of late - Vivaldi decided to move to Vienna, as the Emperor was known to be an admirer of his work. Having sold most of his possessions and many of his original manuscripts, Vivaldi left Venice for Vienna, hopeful that he would obtain Imperial patronage to stage new operas. Unfortunately his untimely death has prevented this, the composer being buried at the Karlskirche in Vienna.

During his lifetime Vivaldi composed around seven hundred pieces of music, his most famous being the landmark work ""Le Quattro Stagioni"" - ""The Four Seasons""."	false

The largest estates are a statement of wealth, complete with dazzling palace-like grand houses in the latest styles and built without thought to the expense. Landowners and the great nobility vie with each other to produce not just houses, but idealized landscapes around them. Where the terrain is not dramatic enough, it is ruthlessly reorganised to suit the owner’s tastes. In the interests of art and beauty the workers, their homes, and their farms are removed from the land.

Historically, a group of landscape architects in Europe completely remodelled many country estates into idyllically perfect vistas for their clients. They created the fantasy of a natural landscape, improving on what was there to make entirely “artificial” (and this was not a term of disapproval at the time) parkland dotted with romantic ruins and gothic follies. In the process, men like Lancelot “Capability” Brown remade hills, flooded valleys, moved rivers, destroyed entire villages and displaced people without mercy. Many of these amazing houses and gardens still exist today, if only as tourist attractions."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_royal_palace_european_gov_republic	"

The “great and the good”, naturally enough, need suitably imposing surroundings to carry out their burdensome law-making duties. Indeed, the magnificence of the building used for representative assemblies can only bolster the honour and prestige of the republic! That it also adds gravitas to the representatives themselves is no more than mere coincidence.

The number of chambers and their methods of selection differ from republic to republic. Nearly all feature one chamber to pass laws and another to revise them.

While the people may have a say in who creates the law, “the great and the good” usually take considerable pains to enfranchise only sections of the people. By carefully excluding voters thanks to age, sex, wealth, religion, birth and geographical location, the political classes can make public support a largely meaningless term. The less astute and largely unwashed masses of the people are important, but that does not mean they should interfere in government business!"	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_screw_breach	"

Instead, a handle underneath the rear of the barrel causes a screw section of the breech to drop away, allowing the user to put a ball and a charge into the barrel. The handle is then turned back; the breech closes and seals the firing chamber. The gun then fires like any other flintlock. Better yet, the screw breech doesn’t require the user to stand in order to be able to use a ramrod to proper effect.

Historically, Major Patrick Ferguson (1744-1780) was the first to produce a practical military weapon with a screw breech. The mechanism was expensive to manufacture, so using it on a rifle was a sensible idea. In expert hands, Ferguson’s rifle was a superb weapon with a high rate of fire, but it was delicate compared to a flintlock. Ferguson’s tactics of skirmishing and sniping at the enemy didn’t fit the prevailing mind set of the British Army of the time. After Ferguson was wounded and no longer an advocate for his rifle or tactics, his unit was disbanded with unseemly haste."	false

Most roads are simply terrible, and bulk cargoes (such as coal) must go by ship anyway: it is the only way of moving goods cheaply and relatively quickly. It also makes the whole world a marketplace, even if the customers are not sure what to make of the goods they are being sent (British merchants insisted on exporting heavy woollen cloth to India for years, even though there was no obvious market for it).

Coastal trade can also be very profitable. For example, a “cheese fleet” did nothing but shuttle back and forth between London and the northwest of England, bringing Cheshire cheeses to the London market. By a happy accident of geology, Cheshire had rock salt mines that provided a preservative for the local cheese to make the sea journey to London. Although salty, this was undoubtedly healthier than most food on a gentleman’s table in the 18th Century!"	false

They are armed with muskets, which are used dismounted in the manner of European-style dragoons, and fight with sabres when they attack while mounted. In either role, they are not quite as effective or efficient as properly specialised soldiers, but the flexibility that they give a commander in their use more than makes up for this lack. They should not be used as shock cavalry, but can prove useful as pursuit forces, or for riding down disorganised opposition.

Historically, the nizam-i-cedit were a “new model” army that used western European military doctrine and practices. The janissary corps vigorously opposed these foreign ideas, because they diminished warriors by expecting them to fight as parts in a machine rather than show individual bravery. This was not the right way to conduct wars, or for righteous men to act. The rest of the Ottoman army rather resented the nizam-i-cedit and the modernity they represented. After the new model corps was created, the second regiment, or orta, of nizam-i-cedit was trained and equipped to operate as mounted infantry rather than line infantry. This was a practical way of increasing mobility on and off the battlefield, and one that copied the original concept of dragoons."	false

Around five hundred tradesmen have been hired to carry out the construction, and thirty wells have been sunk in order to provide drinking water for an estimated six thousand inmates.

technologies_long_description_industry_metal_coke_blast_furnace	"

Iron smelting is traditionally done on a small scale, using charcoal as the fuel for the furnace. Demand for iron is now such that the charcoal burning industry can no longer keep up, simply because there aren’t enough trees to be chopped down for fuel! Instead, new methods using coal and, in particular, coke, can produce more iron of better quality.

Coke is coal that has been heated in a confined space so that its volatile components are driven off, producing a carbonized residue. This burns in the same steady fashion as charcoal, and is an ideal fuel for blast furnaces. In these air is forced through as quickly as possible, quickly raising the temperature and melting the ore.

Historically, it was English ironmaster Abraham Darby (1678–1717) who discovered coke could be used in blast furnaces, and to better effect than charcoal. His iron was not of good quality but could be produced cheaply. He founded a dynasty of ironmasters who are directly responsible for the new “cast iron age” of the early Industrial Revolution."	false

After a scrape on the arm, Mrs Elphinstone apologised and the matter was put to rest with signed statements and a curtsy from both parties, their honour and friendship fully intact."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_agriculture_advanced_irrigation	"

Advanced irrigation is the application of scientific ingenuity and mechanical principles to the use and distribution of water. Marshy landscapes are drained and tamed to make productive and profitable farmland, rivers can be dammed and diverted, ponds and the landscape itself reworked to the benefit of its owners. These advances are leading to the cultivation of land that would previously considered unsuitable for agriculture, providing more food for a growing population.

In Europe, the Dutch were the masters of irrigation and water management – hardly surprising given the low-lying nature of much of the Netherlands! In Asia and India, rice farmers had long practical experience with paddy fields. Crop irrigation is an ancient skill, dating back to the dawn of agriculture: the Egyptians used the yearly flooding of the Nile as the basis of their entire civilization, a dead world that scholars and antiquaries in the late 18th Century were beginning to explore"	false

events_event_text_london_monster	"A man who terrorized London society by following well-to-do ladies and stabbing them in the buttocks has been dubbed ""The Monster"" by the press of London.

More than fifty attacks were reported over a period of two years, many women having been left with torn clothing and knife wounds. Typically the attacks also attracted those who seek attention, with many claiming to have been stalked or struck by the monster. As a result descriptions of the man and his methods varied greatly.

Following a number of false accusations some young men formed a ""No Monster Club"", with badges to show that they were not the monster and to put women at ease. Finally Rhynwick Williams was arrested, after a woman identified him as the man who attacked her. The fact that Williams had alibis for many of the attacks seems to have been ignored in the race to convict somebody, and he was charged with ""defacing clothing"", a crime that carries a heavier penalty than attempted murder. Following a farcical trial and retrial, Williams was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison.

Since then, reports of attacks have reduced in number but haven’t stopped entirely, leading many to wonder if the right man is locked up in Newgate."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_comanche_mounted_warriors	"

The Comanche are gifted horsemen with an unmatched understanding of their horses. These skills allow them to cross even rough ground with terrifying speed, and then pepper an enemy with musket balls and tomahawks. They can then quickly withdraw to safety to reload, or rejoin the main body of a tribal army.

When the Spanish left horses in North America, the Comanche quickly recognised their potential, and rebuilt their lives around the animals.

The Comanche were particularly fond of pinto horses, believing them to be sacred. Pintos were also supposed to give their riders invulnerability in battle."	false

events_event_text_piratey_bishop	"There aren’t many fellows who can lay claim to successful careers in both the priesthood and piracy whilst busy philandering at the same time, but Lancelot Blackburne may be one of them!

Following his education at Christchurch College, Oxford, Blackburne was ordained in 1681, and the young priest set sail for a posting in Antigua at the first opportunity - in order to escape a terminally quiet life in the shires. Blackburne’s disappointment upon finding his wages paid in sugar was enough for him to move to Nevis in the Antilles, where he served aboard a pirate vessel - as either chaplain or buccaneer - before returning to England after only a short time abroad!

In an attempt to settle down into the ecclesiastical life, Blackburne befriended elderly members of the priesthood with a view to securing pleasant accommodation for himself after their deaths, becoming Rector of Calstock and eventually sub-Dean at Exeter Cathedral.

Tellingly, in 1702 Blackburne was accused of adultery with the wife of the interestingly-named Mr Martyr, and evidence was produced detailing a passage between their houses constructed especially to allow the tryst to continue unobserved! Blackburne sensibly resigned from his post at this stage, but was inexplicably reinstated before long.

After spending much of his time in London ingratiating himself with the Court in as many ways as were available to him, Blackburne was made Bishop of Exeter in 1716 and, following even greater displays of idleness and philandering, Archbishop of York in 1724.

After this date little is heard about him of a precise nature, other than to say Archbishop  Blackburne continually failed to carry out his ecclesiastical duties, and devoted much of his time to the pleasures of the flesh. For research purposes only of course!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_wallachian_boyars	"

Wallachian boyars carry sabres but do not wear armour. This aids them in moving quickly across broken ground but makes them vulnerable when in combat against heavy cavalrymen. It would be wasteful to use boyars attacking formed infantry in square, but they are extremely useful in pursuing already-broken enemies. They can also be used to ride down disorganised troops and skirmishers.

Wallachia had been a battleground for over a century, as both the Austrians and the Russians attempted to take the province from the Ottomans during a series of wars. The boyar aristocracy were not, however, always impressed with their new rulers and their absolutist ways: they had often enjoyed more latitude under the Ottomans. Being a boyar was a mark of nobility, and meant that a boyar man owned land, had serfs, and had military duties or obligations. The boyars had begun as elected chiefs but had, over the centuries, become a hereditary class; this meant a man could be “of boyar bones” and aristocratic even if he lacked lands or serfs to work it. As in many other parts of Europe, military service was an honourable, possibly the only, profession for a nobleman."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_polish_winged_hussars	"

These troops are usually members of the nobility, for only they can afford the expense involved in being a member of this prestigious force. They are armed with long lances, sabres and pistols for fighting at close quarters. Their armour and elaborate uniforms, complete with two towering, feathered wings, set them apart from other “hussars”, and make them appear to be a kind of cuirassier to the uneducated eye. Their charge with levelled lances and fearsome appearance is enough to strike terror into many foot troops.

Historically, the Polish Winged Hussars had been inspired by the successes of the Hungarian hussars. Over the centuries since their establishment, they became a heavier, armoured force and, if possible, even more convinced of their elite status. The truth was somewhat different: as the 18th Century dawned, the Winged Hussars were outmoded and, in the face of disciplined firepower, no longer quite as effective as they had once been."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_light_infantry	"

Initiative, aggression and pace of action mark these men out and they consider themselves a cut above other infantry, regardless of the title that they use. Light infantry, jaegers or chasseurs do not mindlessly follow orders, but pick and choose their own ground and targets, using such cover as they can find. They carry standard smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets, but they do not rely on massed volley fire: they deliberately aim (as well as they can, given that muskets lack sights), at individuals within the enemy ranks. This selective fire can disrupt enemy formations or drive off enemy skirmishers. Over time, developments in tactics and weapons will make them very effective as snipers as well as covering forces.

In 1700, many European nations did not recruit light infantry regiments. Each line infantry regiment had a light company, but the mass volley was the proper way to employ firepower. As irregular light troops proved their worth and tribal natives refused to co-operate by fighting formal, set piece battles, it was realised that collecting together light companies in ad hoc regiments was no longer enough. Direct recruitment of light infantry regiments began in earnest, and by the end of the 18th Century every army fielded fast, light regiments."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_gold_mine_european	"

Lit only by candles (which they must buy themselves) or lamps with naked flames, most miners are labouring in conditions that resemble hell on earth. In some mines firedamp (methane) is a constant risk thanks to the candles – an explosion can happen at any time. The risk of a slow death is there too: stone dust and poisonous minerals such as arsenic ruin a man as surely as any explosion. 

There are also accidents. Miners are paid only for the valuable minerals that they extract, so there is little incentive to carry out much work for safety’s sake. Pit props may keep the roof from collapsing, but putting them in does not earn any payment – the miners may even be charged for the materials! And it is not just men who labour below ground. Women often pull carts from the working face to the surface. Children need less space and air than adults, and make ideal support workers, clearing tunnels and bringing food and water to the miners. In smaller seams, children are the perfect labourers.

All of this is secondary, however, to the business of making money, and mining can be a very profitable industry."	false

“Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it…” Kings have long had the freedom to do as they will, often resulting in injustice, cruelty and tyranny. This is the very reason for the development of a theory which proposes splitting power between different and possibly competing departments of government.

Historically, the French political commentator Charles de Secondat (1689-1755) began France’s move away from the “States general” (the division of the French people into the three estates of clergy, the aristocracy and everyone else) under the absolute authority of the King, towards a separation of powers. He was also responsible for the division of government into legislative, executive and judicial parts. One branch makes laws, the second enforces them, and the third oversees the process of justice."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_netherlands_holland_guard	"

These troops are equipped as line infantry, and carry smoothbore muskets. Their uniforms are splendid, and mark them out as a superior unit, in arrogance if nothing else. They are trained to deliver devastating volley fire, and never to waver in the face of a foe. This attitude serves them well in battle, as the Guard can hardly be seen to cut and run, no matter how hot the fight.

Historically, the guards sometimes became the only unit a leader could rely on when politics got out of hand, most of the time. It was not unknown for the Guard to be kingmakers, even in a republic, and only give their protection to their preferred choice of leader. With the turbulent history of the Dutch, the Holland Guard were provided with numerous opportunities to change the national leader. As the 18th century drew to a close, the fire of the French Revolution was spreading through Europe: free thinkers saw the merits of the Revolution and many set their minds on something similar in their own countries."	false

An age of consent has also been introduced, meaning participants under twenty one years old must seek the consent of their parents; and marriages between males aged under fourteen and females aged under twelve years are banned altogether, regardless of parental consent.

Bring in the candles.""

In actuality, the phenomenon was probably a combination of forest fires, cloud cover and thick fog."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_russia_winter_palace	"

It did so magnificently. The location in St. Petersburg was part of Peter’s policy of opening up to western ideas, where they were suitable for Russia, and his adoption of western architecture, culture and technology. The Tsar wanted his Palace to be the centrepiece of a “Third Rome” on the River Neva, and a new Imperial seat of government for all the Russias. It was deliberately built to be a palace rather than a fortress like the Kremlin in Moscow, although the wide prospects and avenues of St. Petersburg certainly made it entirely defensible by musket-armed troops.

The Palace remained as the official home of the Tsars for the next two centuries. It continued to play an important part in Imperial affairs until the end of Tsarist Russia and beyond. The 1905 “Bloody Sunday” massacre of unarmed protestors publicly demonstrated that the Tsar, for all the propaganda about being the “Little Father” of his people, had scant regard for the needs of ordinary folk. The storming of the Winter Palace in 1917 is an iconic moment in Russian history, the defining moment in the establishment of the Soviet state."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_gorodskiye_streltsy	"

The viborniye (“electives” who have chosen to serve in the ranks) and gorodskiye (municipal) streltsy are both hereditary militia. Originally raised from the ranks of tradesmen by Ivan the Terrible, they are an old-fashioned and traditionally-minded group. Over the centuries, membership of the streltsy has been passed down from father to son, and a lack of new volunteers – new blood – has ossified the old ways of battle. The streltsy are reliable, however, in defence of their homeland.

Historically, the streltsy posed a significant challenge to the young Peter the Great (ruled 1682-1725). Angered by changes to the army which removed their traditional privileges (of having an extremely easy life), the streltsy attempted to overthrow Peter. In 1698 they marched on Moscow, intent on replacing him with his sister, Sophia Alekseyevna. Previous attempts to change the system had usually provoked riots by the streltsy – the very people supposed to suppress such trouble – or worse. This time, Peter’s new-model “Western”-fashion forces crushed them. This was not the end to the streltsy, however, as Russia’s precarious position during the Great Northern War (1700-21) meant that Peter had to recall them to the colours."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_advanced_skirmishing	"

Light troops are used to screen the main body of an army and to harass enemies as they approach. To this end, they are usually deployed in a loose skirmish line ahead of the battle line. Advanced skirmishing, however, does away with the concept of a “line”, and has light troops fight in small groups, using whatever cover is nearby. The emphasis of these tactics is not to fight fairly, but to use stealth, concealment, marksmanship, surprise and ambush against the enemy. Further, the men are trained to systematically kill officers, sergeants and other key individuals in a target unit, to create the maximum amount of disruption, confusion and, hopefully, panic.

Historically, skirmishing tactics eventually had to replace the formal battle line; when every man has a rifle it becomes suicidal to advance in rigid formation or to rely on unit élan and the bayonet to carry the day. This was dramatically demonstrated during the American Civil War (1861-65) and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 where infantry casualties during mass attacks were horrendous."	false

These indigenous troops formed hugely effective regiments when used by the European East India companies. They were acclimatised to India with a resilience and endurance that put Europeans to shame. In combat, they typically display unwavering bravery and a tenacious determination.

Often recruited from barren or mountainous regions, these men are tough and hard working. Loyal without question, their familiarity with local culture allowed Europeans to fight insurgencies and unrest with understanding as well as brute force.

The sepoys of the British East India Company were typical in that they had native and European officers. “Natives” never commanded Company battalions, but their opinions were always sought by the better sort of European officer. The Ghoorkas were a special case, because Nepal was never colonised, but a treaty was made between the company and the native king."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_naval_architecture_advances	"

The struggle to find a perfect design for a ship of the line occupies many minds in many admiralties around the world. Ideally, the perfect design for each type of vessel will be a standard, repeatable plan that any competent shipwright can execute. There must be compromise between the various elements of the ship: armament and its type, speed, sail area, strength of hull, endurance (in terms of supplies carried) and so forth. If any of these are unbalanced, then the ship will sail or fight poorly, and the fleet be weakened as a result.

Historically, distinct “classes” of warships built to standardised designs emerged by a process of experimentation. Shipwrights were expected to naval architects rather than build ships by rule of thumb, the way things had always been done. Navies encouraged the practice because a certain pleasing neatness resulted if ships were built to recognised standards. In Britain, for example, the work of Sir Thomas Slade (1704-71) was exceptional: he produced a standard plan for the third rate 74, and over 40 ships were built to his design."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_carronade_frigate	"

Normally frigates would be armed with long guns, probably no larger than 12-pounders. A few short-barrelled 64-pounder carronades might be aboard to give a close-in broadside more weight of shot. A carronade frigate goes one better, and carries nothing but carronades – short guns that are half the weight of the equivalent conventional cannon. While the weight of a broadside is truly awesome, the frigate has to get in close in order to blow an enemy to smithereens thanks to the carronades’ limited range. A clever enemy will stay out of range of the carronades’ horrendous power and take long range pot shots.

Historically, only the Royal Navy experimented with an all-carronade armament aboard HMS Glatton (in service from 1795). Glatton carried 28 64-pounder and 28 32-pounder carronades, giving a weight of fire that was more than 17% greater than HMS Victory could deliver at the Battle of Trafalgar! This massive firepower allowed her, on one occasion, to chase all eight vessels in a French squadron back into port. Oddly enough, the next two vessels to carry the name “Glatton” in RN service were also massively over-armed."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_timber_logging_camp_european	"

Apart from its obvious uses in construction and as fuel, timber is vital for shipbuilding. All vessels of the period are entirely wooden, and need hundreds of tons of good quality timber, of many kinds, each. Frames and structural members, for example, are made of oak. Buildings also use large amounts of wood both in the structure and during the building process as scaffolding.

Historically, the forests of the eastern seaboard of America were an extremely useful strategic resource, as they became an excellent source of the trees needed for masts and yards for the British Royal Navy. By their nature, masts need tall trees! Other types of timber became important cash crops, such as the mahogany found in the Far East, prized for its strength and beauty."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_bawdy_house_european	"

Although considered illegal and immoral in many cultures, prostitution takes place on what can only be described as an industrial scale in many cities. It is estimated that in London as many as one in six of the population had some link to the underworld of bawdyhouses. In other parts of the world there was less stigma attached to being a prostitute, but the life is always a hard one, open to exploitation and with the constant danger of violence from both clients and bawdyhouse owners. Bawdyhouses range from very high-class establishments where customers are by invitation only to backrooms in filthy taverns - and everything in between. 

Life was hard in 18th Century Europe for women; other than service, there were few honest jobs open to them and prostitution was always an easy option, especially for the young and good looking. It became the lot of many by default. Probably the most famous representation of the corruption of a woman was Hogarth’s “A Harlot’s Progress”, a series of six illustrations showing a young girl arriving in London, being inveigled into whoredom, and then gradually debauched, broken and finally dead (of the pox). It was the fate of all too many."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_crow_horse_warriors	"

Crow Horse Warriors can employ two tactics in warfare to great effect. Firstly, they can wear an enemy down with arrows; they can then demolish them by charging home and doing terrible work with their axes. Fear is a stranger to Crow warriors: the battlefield is a chance to prove that a warrior has mettle, and so improve his standing within the tribe.

Historically, the Crow gave recognition and status to individuals who had achieved much in war. They could take part in religious ceremonies, name children and gain rank and reputation within the tribe. Warriors who ‘counted coup’ against enemies would decorate their war shirts with rosettes, or wear wolf tails at the heels of their moccasins. Conversely, anti-social behaviour was punished: the Crow had ‘joking relatives’ whose job was to shame each other into behaving appropriately. If good behaviour wasn’t observed, the next step was exile, or the destruction of the offender’s lodge and belongings."	false

events_event_text_bellamy_killed	"Twenty eight year old pirate captain ""Black Sam"" Bellamy - so called as he did not wear a white powdered wig, instead growing his own black hair - has been shipwrecked on a sandbar off the coast of New England with his flagship Whydah and prize ships laden with booty. Just nine men have survived the wrecks, seven of whom have already been picked up and will stand trial for piracy.

Bellamy began his career trying to salvage some of the many shipwrecks along the Florida coastline, but soon turned to piracy when his chosen line of work proved fruitless. Joining the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, Bellamy soon proved his mettle and usurped power and command of the ship Marianne. Before long a second ship, Sultana, was taken - exchanged for the three-hundred ton slaver Whydah shortly after that.

Throughout his short career in piracy, Bellamy became known for his kindness, mercy and generosity - both to his victims and the men who served with him - earning him the name the ""Prince of Pirates""."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_mass_production	"

Craft-based manufacturing of any kind has a ceiling on the number of goods that it can produce. The goods themselves may be beautifully made, but the number of expert workers is the limitation; people can only make so many things if they are doing everything for themselves.

Mass production mechanises the basic and repetitive tasks of production, and divides work into simple, repetitive and repeatable tasks. No longer does a master craftsman labour to make one item from start to finish. Instead, work is broken down into simple tasks and each given to a worker with the item passing to the next person for the next task. Each job is simple, so mechanical aids and tools can be used in place of expertise.

Marc Brunel (1769-1849) was a French engineer who fetched up in England after the French Revolution. His block-making machines are a typical example of mass production in the period. They let unskilled labour make the blocks and pulleys needed in their thousands by the Royal Navy – blocks were a vital part of ship’s rigging."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_military_hospital_european	"

Many military hospitals are not purely medical or surgical facilities, but charitable institutions. Their purpose is to look after old and infirm veterans who will otherwise starve after leaving the colours. Old age pensions and veterans’ benefits are an exception rather than the norm, and poor laws exist to keep the poor out of sight rather than to alleviate their poverty. Military hospitals also provide a convenient source of experienced, if somewhat lame, recruits for many governments – reliable men for garrison duty.

The 18th Century was not a time to be sick, old and poor and, in many countries, propertied individuals recognised this unfortunate fact. Some colonels did look after their own men, sometimes. John Manners, the Marquis of Granby (1721-1770), for example, had the rather splendid habit of giving his non-commissioned officers enough money to buy taverns at the end of their military service, which explains why England (still) has so many public houses named “The Marquis of Granby”! He is also reputedly the source of the remark “to go at someone bald-headed”, a result of losing his wig during a cavalry charge at Warburg in 1760, and gave the British Army its GRANBY codename for the 1991 Gulf War."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_elite_frei-korps	"

On the battlefield, they are skirmishers used to counter enemy light troops that cause problems to the highly regimented Prussian regulars. Those recruited into the Frei-corps include foreign mercenaries, ex-prisoners and deserters from other armies. Their less-than-reputable nature makes the Frei-corps perfect for raids and independent operations where the ability to live off the land (by stealing) is more important than parade ground drill. They travel light and their uniforms are deliberately plain to avoid drawing unwelcome attention.

Historically, Fredrick the Great (1740-86) had little respect for the Frei-corps. He was a believer in discipline and drill in soldiers, and the independence of light troops held little appeal. The men were basically sneaky and professional rascals and this was simply un-gentlemanly and dishonourable to the 18th Century mind. Frederick’s army was supremely disciplined, but even he had to accept that sometimes a certain “flexibility” was required, hence the Frei-corps.

Despite the name, the Freikorps formed in Germany after the Great War had little in common with these 18th Century troops, as they were “free” brigades of anti-communist ex-soldiers, returning from the front with no prospects and little loyalty to the Weimar Republic."	false

The bow is a practical tool: it puts food in bellies as well as killing enemies. A skilled bowman can stalk his prey (man or beast) in utter silence, before killing with a well-aimed shot of a broad-headed arrow, designed to cause massive bleeding. In the time it takes to fire and reload a musket, a good bowman can fire half a dozen aimed shots, and probably have moved to better ground while doing so.

In the early days of their contact with the various foreign powers that colonized America, the tribes were glad to co-operate with them, and formed alliances with the French, British and Dutch. The tribes soon became involved in trade, and often ended up fighting proxy wars on behalf of their allies."	false

In practice a market also makes it safer for craftsmen to specialise in particular items, as they can be assured of finding a buyer for their goods. The day-to-day business of haggling and barter makes the market a noisy and cheerful place, even if the curses brought down on good bargain hunters sound fearsome! Trade with outsiders gives the tribe access to items they cannot make for themselves, including some things that are not always beneficial: the Europeans are too happy to trade in strong liquor."	false

These horsemen have many national titles, and military fashion plays a huge part in their employment and naming: light horse, chasseurs à cheval, chevau-légers, even hussars and dragoons are used as titles by light cavalry forces. Regardless of the name, their purpose, tactics and equipment usually have much in common. They disdain armour, even the sensible steel skull caps favoured by many beneath their officially sanctioned tricornes and helmets. They carry swords, carbines and pistols, but they are not expected to charge home, merely harass and pursue enemies. Their horses are always fast with good endurance, well bred and well looked after: a cavalryman without his horse is, after all, useless.

Traditionally, light cavalry forces also undertook the role of communications for an army. Their speedy horses made them ideal for carrying messages between camps, or as gallopers on the battlefield. They were also among the most “dandified” of soldiers, and light cavalry uniforms of the period are some of the gaudiest ever created. This made recruitment easy, because prospective troopers could see what a dashing figure they would cut for the ladies!"	false

Built on the site of an older fortress called the Three Crowns, the current Palace is actually its second incarnation as the first building was destroyed in fire in 1697. The current version was designed by Count Nicodemus Tessin (the Younger), an able Baroque architect and city planner, and took the best part of 50 years to complete in brick and sandstone. Much of the surrounding city was also re-laid as moats and the like were filled in.

The Palace is still in use as the official residence of the Swedish monarchy, and houses significant museum collections, including the Livrustkammaren, or Royal Armoury within its 609 rooms. This is the oldest museum in Sweden, established by the great Gustavus Adolphus in 1628 when he decided to keep and display his equipment from his Polish campaigns. The various departments of the royal court and household are also still based in the palace, as are the Högvakten, the Royal Guard of the Svea Livgarde (Lifeguards), who have been a part of Palace life since the 1750s."	false

The Royal Museum was founded in 1792 by King Gustav III, and gave a home to his exquisite artwork collection. It now forms the core of the Swedish Nationalmuseum. 

Gustav was an absolutist, as might be expected of a nephew of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He objected to parliamentary reforms, sought to distract everyone’s attention with an unsuccessful war against Russia and ignored public opinion. Although he was a playwright and a patron of music, the arts and sciences, and spent liberally on all of them, he did so without gaining much popularity among the people or nobles. His museum was the result of his free spending ways: where art was concerned, he was rather liberal with his money.

In the end, Gustav was assassinated by a conspiracy of noblemen at the Royal Opera House, an event that itself was turned into an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, Un ballo in maschera (The Masked Ball). Verdi had to change many of the details due to government censorship, as the assassination of a monarch was felt to be a bit too controversial in Italy of the 1850s."	false

Dressed in the finest uniforms, their saddles encrusted in precious gems, their weapons and equipment likewise, their horses perfectly turned out and decorated with tassels, the Ahadis would look entirely at home guarding a magnificently-appointed palace. They are capable of that, but they are also capable of so much more. These are practical warriors for a working battle, with a good grasp of tactics and the skills needed to cut almost any enemy to ribbons. As they charge home the tassels make each horse appear winged!

It is more efficient to ship half-finished planks and logs than tree trunks, thus increasing the profits from logging. Even though most of the equipment used is brought in from home, a lumber mill on a good site can easily repay the investment. The hard work needed to dig a mill pond and race, as well as carefully position a waterwheel is also handsomely repaid when a powered saw starts work.

Historically, it was possible for a logging operation to denude a forest of all of its profitable trees, in the process causing terrible environmental damage. Without the trees, the soil is soon gone, washed away in the first strong rains. It then becomes almost impossible for any kind of forest to re-establish itself. This worried hardly anyone in the 18th Century (there were exceptions – some men did go out of their way to plant trees so that navies would never be without supplies), as the world had been given to men to subdue, and there were always more trees in the next valley."	false

Exploiting natural animal resources is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of making profit from virgin territory. It takes training, luck and money to extract mineral wealth; almost anyone – if they are tough enough – can hunt, or trade with the natives, for pelts.

Historically, men looking for animal pelts for the finest furs explored swathes of North America and the Siberian wilderness. In America, it was beaver pelts that drove the traders further into the hinterland; in Siberia it was sable pelts that drove traders deeper into the wilds. Demand for furs at home in Europe was almost insatiable, probably helped by a cold period in the climate and a singular lack of effective central heating!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_sp_ed_hms_victory	"

Like all first rates, Victory is not a handy ship, being both slow and unresponsive. Good sailing qualities, however, are secondary to the weight of broadside that she can both deliver and withstand. This is important in a warship that is intended to form the centrepiece of any squadron and act as an admiral’s flagship.

Completed in 1765, Victory is probably the most famous first rate in history, and the only one still in existence. The work of naval architect and genius Sir Thomas Slade, Victory was always intended to be a flagship; the Royal Navy preferred the smaller 74s as battleships. Forty years later, in 1805, she was Horatio Nelson’s flagship at Trafalgar, a battle which gave the Royal Navy undisputed mastery of the world’s oceans for more than a century.

As of 2008, the ship is still the flagship to “CINCNAVHOME”, a rather unromantic NATO-speak acronym for the Royal Navy’s Second Sea Lord. The ship is in dry dock in southern England as part of the Portsmouth Dockyards museum. Modern RN warships still salute the Victory as they enter and leave harbour."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_guerillas	"

Guerrillas are not a recognised military organisation at all, but bands of friends and neighbours who have adapted banditry to be a way of making war. They fight hard, because if they are captured they can expect little mercy from an enemy: at best, a trial before inevitable execution. War and vendetta are often the same thing for guerrillas: wrongs done and the resulting hatred are what drive them to fight. They are best when employed in ambush, or to skirmish and harass. They cannot be expected to fight in carefully dressed lines like soldiers, because they are not soldiers.

Historically, the Spanish people had an enormous capacity for carrying on wars against foreign occupiers long after their rulers had capitulated or made their peace with an enemy. Guerrillas arose as an act of rebellion. The name itself is Spanish, and means “little war”: the constant skirmishing and sniping that wears out an occupying army. When his men were bogged down there, Napoleon described Spain as an “ulcer”, thanks in part to the constant partisan warfare carried on by the guerrillas."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_carronades	"

Carronade differ from the normal warship “long guns” by having a shortened barrel, relative to the weight of shot. Short barrels require reduced gunpowder charges; large charges would be wasted because they would not have time to burn properly. This gives a reduced muzzle velocity, less recoil, and a lighter weapon. As a further benefit, carronades require fewer gunners to fire them. There is, however, a tactical price to pay: carronades are short-range weapons. In close, but only in close, they can do fearful slaughter.

Historically, the carronade was developed by the Carron Company of Fife, Scotland. It was a huge success initially, as the weight of shot more than made up for its short range: 68-pounder carronades were quite easily carried aboard even small ships. HMS Victory carried 68-pounder carronades as part of her armament: one raking round shot and a load of 500 musket balls did terrible slaughter on the gun deck of the Bucentaure at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805."	false

events_event_text_circular_saw	"A patent for a ""saw windmill"" has been granted to Samuel Miller of Southampton. The common carpenter’s saw blade is transformed into a metal disc, with saw teeth cut into the circumference.

Once mounted on a table designed for the purpose, the disc is driven by a water wheel. Thus, it is able to rapidly incise through timbers of great strength and girth. Naval blockmaker Walter Taylor (also of Southampton) also claims he is the originator of this invention, and though he holds several patents for blockmaking, we do not know for sure who is right and who is merely a ""saw"" loser."	false

events_event_text_jonathan_wild_swings	"The man long thought to be the leading officer of the law, the self-styled ""Thief-Taker General"" - Jonathan Wild - has been revealed to be no better than the common criminals he sought to apprehend.

Running a network of thieves bolstered by blackmail through fear of the gallows, Wild waited for crimes to be reported before returning stolen items and claiming any rewards - the profits of which were split unfavourably with his ""agents"". Any one of them who complained about Wild’s unfair policy would be handed over to be hanged as thieves, as would any known thief refusing to co-operate with his policy and any rivals who might reveal the true nature of his activities to the authorities. Wild was responsible for the executions of over sixty thieves due to his actions, and provided the Privy Council with advice resulting in a one hundred pound increase for turning in thieves.

After constructing a façade of heroism via clever manipulation of the press, Wild came unstuck when he took part in a violent gaol break for one of his gang members. Finding himself in Newgate, Wild then fell foul a plan by his own agents to rid themselves of him once and for all. Many of them gave evidence against him, revealing all aspects of his dastardly business practices, and he was sentenced to death.

When Wild’s day at the Tyburn Tree came he became terribly afraid, and took a large quantity of the opiate laudanum in an attempt to kill himself. Although he didn't die, Wild fell into a coma and was hanged in this state on the morning of 24th May, to much rejoicing from the large crowd gathered to see his execution."	false

Of particular note was his demonstration of the ignition of gases by an electrical spark, by which method his ""electric-phlogopneumatic pistol"" was seen to fire a cork for an appreciable distance, accompanied by an impressive ""pop!"" sound. This display is in keeping with current fashions of philosophical presentation, which often combine serious scientific reasoning with a pleasing element of showmanship.

As well as the more obvious martial implications of this new knowledge, Count Volta has suggested a long-distance communications device based upon it. Such a device would use iron rods to pass an electrical charge to a distant receiving station, there entering into a gas-filled vessel and resulting in an explosion indicating some predefined signal or message."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_european	"

In the Medieval period, castles had relied on high walls to make them impregnable and to give them a sense of overwhelming grandeur – part of their purpose was simply to intimidate lesser men. With the advent of gunpowder artillery, a different defensive scheme was required. Fortifications sank into the ground, protected by enormously thick walls, deep counterscarps and a sloping bank or glacis that would, hopefully, cause cannon shots to ricochet over the defences rather than penetrate.

Passive defence, however, is not enough. The layout of projecting bastions in a star fort creates interlocking fields of flanking fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. In theory, no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous attack from the defenders. The star shape evolved so that no part of the defences would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing zone for artillery weapons and defensive musketry. 

Historically, the most notable creator of star forts was the French military engineering genius, Marshall Vauban (1633-1707); his name is virtually synonymous with the design. His defences at Verdun were still in use during the battle there in 1916 during the First World War."	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_explosive_rockets	"

A war rocket is an iron cylinder, packed with gunpowder, with a long wooden stick as a tail. It functions in much the same way as a firework, but with infinitely deadlier consequences. Launched from a simple angled trough, rockets are not particularly accurate, but they are extremely frightening and have an incendiary effect on the target too. They can be fired from ships (with some risk to the firing vessel) and from battlefield launchers too.

Historically, rocketry in European warfare was a consequence of nasty surprises inflicted at the hands of Indian rocket troops, particularly those of Tippoo Sultan, the “Tiger of Mysore”. They had long been a part of Indian and Asian warfare, and the invading Europeans were merely new targets. The British, ready as always to adopt a foreign weapon when it suited, had their own version thanks to the work of (honorary) Colonel William Congreve (1772-1828). His work gave the Royal Navy and, eventually, the Royal Artillery, a fearsome weapon. More sophisticated unguided artillery rockets are still in use by modern armies."	false

events_event_text_mungo_park_segu	"Long thought dead, intrepid Scots explorer Mungo Park has returned from uncharted Africa against the odds with his life and the discovery of the course of the Niger river.

Contracted to the African Association after returning from Sumatra - where he journeyed as a surgeon of the East India Company, Park agreed to the hazardous exploration despite the disappearance of the Association’s previous employee, Daniel Houghton - who was never seen again.

Reaching Africa in early 1795, Park moved north along the Gambia river towards its source, before crossing the upper basin of Senegal with only two local guides and the minimum of provisions. Whilst crossing the arid Kaarta region he was failed by his poor knowledge of Arabic and captured by Moors who imprisoned him at Ludamar for several months. Park eventually escaped with only a horse and a pocket compass - almost one year since beginning his epic journey. One month later Park finally reached the Niger at Segu. He is the first and only European to date to do so. Park then began to follow the Niger’s course down river, travelling eighty miles to Silla before a lack of resources forced him to stop. For his return to Gambia, Park decided to follow the Niger’s course as closely as possible, eventually covering and tracing the course of the river for three hundred miles before falling ill with a terrible fever.

After several months recovering at the home of a kindly African, Park got back to his base at the British Trading Post at Pisania in June 1797. He reached Scotland in December of that year, almost three years after he originally set out.

Now heralded as a national hero and having more than proved his worth as an explorer, Park has published an account of his adventures as ""Travels in the Interior of Africa"", and is preparing for an equally dangerous return trip. This time, Park is undertaking to find the source of the Niger river, and taking a detachment of soldiers and support staff with him."	false

Like many aspects of the Native American way of life, fishing is dependent upon the seasons. Ice fishing in winter is a cold, lonely and slow business compared to using nets and lures in spring. The arrival of fish off the coast and in rivers is also tied to the passing seasons.

Fish often play a key part in mythology, none more than the salmon. One tale tells of a salmon becoming involved in a contest for a chief’s daughter. The contest saw the salmon break a set of elk antlers into pieces to win the hand of the young maiden."	false

This magnificent structure is the beating heart of an empire, its nerve centre and the glory of the nation given physical form. Every carved detail, every piece of luxurious inlay, every painted ceiling, every tile on the floor, has been paid for by the blood and sweat of the nation’s people, and all to glorify the person of the monarch. The ruler and his state are one, for under an absolute system of government, all power resides in the person of the monarch. The court exists only to provide obedient servants, as an absolutist system can permit no rivals to the throne. The servants of the state must be kept firmly in their place, and made to remember that they wield borrowed (at best) power. The source of power needs a suitably magnificent setting, a public stage where upstarts can be broken and brought to heel, subtly or otherwise.

All royal palaces, no matter what culture produces them, represent a substantial investment of national wealth. From Versailles in France to the palaces of the Sultan in Istanbul, money was no object when it came to royal luxury. Taxes, after all, belong to the monarch in person, not the state."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_household_cavalry	"

Royal guards are elite, but they are also a court regiment where appearance is as important as fighting ability. As gentlemen they are hardly expected to associate with the common sort of soldier, and this does not make them popular or respected with the rest of the army. They are also often unloved by the general populace too, as they are the last line of defence for the royal family, and this may mean that they are sometimes required to turn their swords on their countrymen to put down domestic trouble.

Historically, perhaps the oddest sounding of the various royal guard cavalry regiments were the curiously named horse grenadier guards. Common sense would seem to indicate that these men would only ever get to throw their grenades once, before their horses took off at speed towards all points of the compass! In British service the Household Cavalry regiments did not, and do not, have sergeants: they have a rank “corporal of horse”. The word “sergeant” has the same origins as “servant”, and no gentleman, even a private trooper, is ever a servant."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_britain_british_museum	"

Many 18th Century gentleman collectors exhibited a “cabinet of curiosities” to friends and rivals. Competition for the most noteworthy and prestigious items soon meant that “cabinets” were often whole rooms or suites set aside for this expensive hobby. Studying the curiosities themselves also became a respectable field of scholarly endeavour by antiquarians, a strange collection themselves of dusty, rum coves with limited social skills.

The British Museum began as one of these collections, but George II donated the Old Royal Library, thus guaranteeing that every book ever published in Britain would end up on its library shelves. Further equally generous gifts, such as Garrick’s library of plays, and shrewd purchases made sure that the collection of antiquities grew at a prodigious rate. Sir William Hamilton (the husband of Emma Hamilton, the mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson) profited quite handsomely when he sold his collection of Roman and Greek items to the Museum. He had collected them, as a hobby, for next to nothing while the ambassador in Naples, Italy. It probably took his mind off being cuckolded.

The Museum also became home to spoils of exploration and conquest: objects collected during Captain Cook’s expedition to the South Seas were exhibited at the museum for a time. The Rosetta stone also ended up in the Museum, having been captured from the French after Napoleon’s abortive attempt to conquer Egypt."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_heavy_cavalry	"

Heavy cavalry are so called to distinguish them from the light cavalry forces. It is not the job of heavy cavalry to pursue enemies. It is their lot to use their speed and weight directly against enemies, battering them into breaking by shock of impact. To this end, they are usually armed with fearsome heavy swords that are quite capable of skewering a man or carving him in two. This role often means that heavy cavalry are held as a reserve by a wise general, so that they can be used to batter a hole in a critically weakened part of an enemy line.

Historically, there was debate during the period about the purpose of cavalry forces. Some generals favoured having their men close with the enemy and use “cold steel” for its terrifying morale impact. Britain’s John Churchill favoured this approach, keeping his men short of ammunition while on campaign so that they weren’t tempted to use any bullets in battle! The other school of thought, naturally enough, favoured using cavalry firepower to break enemy formations. Heavy cavalry did, therefore carry carbines and pistols, depending on the army they served in."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_small_arms_factory_european	"

Centralising the provision of weapons is a sensible thing to do when raising large armies: equipping recruits with standardised items standardises weapons drill and unit tactics, and makes supply issues easier to manage. It also cuts down on the chances of manufacturers supplying shoddy or downright dangerous firearms, something that is always a temptation for profit-minded contractors.

A small arms factory does not replace private arms manufacturers. While the soldiers make do with government-made weapons, it is usual for officers to purchase their own equipment. Many craft-based armaments firms can thrive by making bespoke items for wealthy gentlemen.

Historically, the French Charville and British “Brown Bess Land Pattern” muskets were outstandingly successful designs, and remained in service for over a century each, with minor modifications. This standardisation was a major step forward in tactical and, more importantly, logistical terms. Armies could no longer entirely live off the land; ammunition and powder had to be made and sent to the troops. With standard designs, it also became possible to “cannibalise” damaged weapons for spare parts, something that was impossible if weapons were locally bought by individual regiments."	false

technologies_long_description_industry_textile_natives_government_money_economy	"Bartering has been the only form of trade in tribal society for generations, with beads and pelts acting as easily understandable currencies. The introduction of a system of money makes buying and selling goods a much less complicated affair, allowing the tribe to create wealth without just accumulating goods. It also makes collecting taxes much easier because, for any government, money is easier to use than a stack of animal pelts!

Historically, Native Americans used a currency known as wampum, which consisted of a variety of small shell beads. Once Europeans arrived in America they adopted the use of wampum, as the easiest way to trade with the natives. Just like any other form of currency, wampum could be affected by inflation. The beads had originally been hand crafted by skilled tribesmen. However, factories were developed for making wampum, making it virtually valueless."	false

start_pos_factions_description_-1605996235	The Iroquois Confederacy represent an alliance of six native tribes who share a common language and homeland in the north west of America. They call themselves “Haudenosaunee”, loosely translated as “People of the Longhouse”. During their tenure in America the French named them “Iroquois”, a word derived from the Huron-Wyandot word meaning “Black Snake”. The hostility between the Iroquois and their neighbours is the result of conflicts over fur trading. The Huron-Wyandot traded with the French and, because of this, the Iroquois naturally found themselves allied with the British. This aided them in battle, eventually contributing to the expulsion of the French from America. They also supported Great Britain during the American War of Independence, something that now places them at odds with the United States. Fortunately the Iroquois are masters of irregular warfare: appearing from the undergrowth, striking at their targets, and disappearing again as quickly as they arrived. What they lack in terms of technology and firepower, the Iroquois make up for with guile, cunning, and ruthless brutality when on the warpath.	false

campaigns_description_episodic_1	"In April 1607, three Virginia Company ships sailed into Chesapeake Bay under the command of Captain Christopher Newport. They made landfall on the southernmost peninsula in the bay, naming it Cape Henry in honour of the Prince of Wales. Life for the early settlers was far from easy, even though they ruled themselves.

Newport returned to England for supplies, leaving Captain John Smith, an acquitted mutineer, in charge. With limited food supplies, the constant presence of disease, and the danger of attack by the native tribes, many of the settlers perished within a few months of reaching the New World.

If this new community is to flourish they will need food, in the shape of farms and fisheries. A cash crop like tobacco will prove the financial viability of the colony to those back home in England and much-needed income for the settlers. Complacency, however, is dangerous. The native tribes remain a threat…"	false

campaigns_description_episodic_3	"The French and Indian Wars began as the result of British and French rivalries in North America, and were part of a larger, globe-spanning conflict between the two nations. In 1754 both countries wanted control of the Ohio Valley, an uncharted but potentially valuable area. Each built a chain of forts into the valley to stake their claims, and conflict was inevitable, as struggles between native tribes were used to foment further trouble.

The war was a tough experience for the British. Both sides quickly realised that alliances with local tribes would be an asset. The French were better at using the North American terrain to their advantage, and early clashes saw heavy British losses. However, it was during this conflict that a young officer called George Washington began his military career.

To secure America, the British must remove the French threat. Take control of the Ohio Valley. Fort Niagara must be in British hands if an attack on the southern fort of Louisburg is to succeed, and allow a campaign northwards to Quebec and Montréal."	false

campaigns_description_episodic_5	"In 1775 a storm is brewing in America. Following the end of the French and Indian Wars, many people in the Thirteen Colonies are increasingly incensed by the British. Laws and new taxes are being imposed from London, and “seditious talk” of revolution is no longer a whisper.

Discontent is widespread, but it is not until a morning in April, 1775 that talk becomes warfare. In Lexington, a group of British soldiers open fire on local militiamen. This skirmish, the Battle of Lexington and Concord, saw the first shots fired in a conflict that would split families, divide friends, and tear apart an empire.

And so the fight for America’s freedom has truly begun. Until the British are removed from the Thirteen Colonies Americans shall never be truly free. If the British Army is to be driven out, the Americans will need help. Allying yourself with the enemies of the British could provide the experienced troops required to remove them from America once and for all."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_pocket_chronometer	"

A pocket chronometer is a practical tool for practical seamen, rather than a carefully engineered scientific measuring device. It can withstand rough treatment by men who are unacquainted with delicate machinery indeed, men with no experience of machinery more complicated than a flintlock! It can also keep excellent time for years on end if treated with a degree of respect. This is an important ability given that sea voyages can last months or years before a home port is visited again.

In practical terms, the 18th Century pocket chronometer is what would nowadays be called a “ruggedized” redesign of the original longitude watch. English watchmakers John Arnold (1736-1799) and Thomas Earnshaw (1749-1829) each made superb chronometers and government prizes for doing so; indeed, Earnshaw’s mechanisms are still found in mechanical marine chronometers made today. Arnold, however, should not be dismissed as he managed to make a watch small enough to be mounted in a signet ring for George III, and provided the timepieces for Captain Cook’s voyages."	false

events_event_text_potato_mandate	"Following disease epidemics and famine in Prussian lands, the peasantry have been instructed to grow potatoes in order to survive.

Long-dismissed as a mere novelty food across Europe, the potato is in fact an abundant and nutritious source of food, a great crop that can be harvested through very little effort on the part of the planter, and of course the whole process can be turned around in half the time required to propagate the equivalent crop of wheat.

The peasants are of course unhappy about a royal mandate that literally denies them their daily bread, but the soldiers dispatched to enforce the law should go some way to improve their dispositions on the matter."	false

technologies_long_description_military_army_fire_by_rank	"

By careful timing, it is possible for a constant fire to be maintained for, as soon as one rank has fired, it begins reloading. By the time other ranks in the unit have fired in their turn, all men should be reloaded and ready to give fire once more. This requires a good level of discipline and obedience, as each rank must listen only to orders from the relevant officers and sergeants. The drill involved in loading a smoothbore musket must also be mastered by every man in the unit. Carried out correctly, the result is a series of volleys that give enemies no respite from a hail of musket balls!

Historically, it was usual for units to draw up in formations three ranks deep, this being considered the “best” compromise between weight of fire and ease of control. Deeper formations were tried, but there was always a risk to men in the forward ranks from careless shots from the rearmost ranks – men were shot in the back by inexperienced comrades. Of course, this firing pattern also meant that only one man in three was ever loaded and ready to fire at any given time."	false

Easily recognisable by their distinctive animal skins and feathered shields, these troops are recruited from many peoples. They have an ethos of personal, rather than collective, bravery. The animal skins worn include wolf, leopard and bear pelts, and their winged shields are enhanced by attaching bird feathers to them. They are armed with scimitars, and these can cause terrible slashing wounds in hand-to-hand combat. The task of the scouts, though, is to avoid combat, seek out the enemy and return with news.

Historically, Deli infantry men and cavalry were irregular troops, and deli horsemen would often find employment guarding caravans and important dignitaries."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_bomb_ketch	"

Strongly-built bomb ketches must withstand the recoil of repeated mortar discharges. Often chains replace the rigging ropes nearest the mortar to prevent muzzle blast damage. They are the only naval vessels to carry and use explosive shells, making them a hazardous assignment. As a mark of all their explosive qualities, they often had volcanic names! The fact that the ketch should be at anchor in order to fire accurately also makes them easy targets for any return fire. 

Bomb ketches are not good sailing ships. The mortar has to be on the centre line, with a clear vertical field of fire. This means that the masts had to be aft of their ideal positions, making the ship handling qualities rather poor. With these limitations in mind, however, they are a powerful addition to any admiral’s firepower. The ability to deliver shells by indirect fire (lobbing shells into fortifications, for example) is very useful. 

Historically, the bomb ketch was a French invention, but other nations perfected the idea. The British mounted the mortar on a rotating platform so that it was no longer necessary to move the whole vessel to change aim. “The Star-Spangled Banner”, the US national anthem, commemorates these ships with the line “the bombs bursting in air.”"	false

His method of testing is to insert a brass pipe into the artery of a horse, to which a glass tube is attached, then observing that the blood within the tube could be seen to rise - and has concluded that this must be due to pressure.

Presently, the method of observing this phenomenon is highly invasive, so the medical benefits of this discovery may take a while to present themselves."	false

Their horses are for mobility, not for any shock value in battle and are often little better than nags and ponies, rather than decent warhorses. In battle, this is unimportant as light dragoons dismount and form a skirmish line to harass an enemy and screen the main body of their own army.

The main weapon carried is a shortened musket, originally termed a “dragon” or dragoon (like “rifle”, the term came to be applied to the man carrying the gun). This is not an accurate weapon, but is no worse than any other smoothbore.

Light dragoons are also useful in suppressing riotous and rebellious civilians. Their horses give them strategic mobility, allowing them to police large areas effectively and come to the aid of the local authorities.

Historically, dragoons lost their role as mounted infantry over the course of the 18th Century, and became another kind of light cavalry, although they retained the name. The officers and men welcomed the change to a role that had a higher social status (and usually better pay rates)."	false

events_event_text_pants_on_fire	"Mary Tofts of Godalming has recently been the subject of no little attention following her claims to have given birth to no less than sixteen rabbits!

The apparently pregnant Mrs Tofts was weeding when she chased away two rabbits, causing her to miscarry her child. From that moment on Tofts claims that she dreamed of rabbits constantly - that the trauma had caused ""such a longing"" for a child that her pregnancy continued, eventually producing nine complete baby rabbits and the arms, legs, etc. of several others.

Dumbfounded, the local midwife sent letters to noted medical men from around the country, piquing the interest of several famous surgeons and anatomists sufficiently to attend. The doctors eventually proclaimed the births to be due to ""maternal impressions"" - where the experiences of the pregnant woman could directly affect the foetus within her, causing it to develop in a deformed way.

After catching a porter smuggling a dead rabbit into Mrs Toft’s room, she was forced to admit that the whole affair had been a hoax - leaving much egg on the faces of certain until-that-moment-well-respected members of the medical profession!"	false

After much deliberation and the rejection of Buckingham House, the trustees have decided on Montagu House as a suitable venue, purchasing the house for twenty thousand pounds."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_france_arc_de_triomphe	"

All armies and nations need to mark their victories and honour their dead. The Arc de Triomphe was the largest structure of its type ever designed, and was intended to be a grandiloquent gesture of French military superiority. This, given that Napoleon Bonaparte had direction of the French army, was entirely reasonable.

Created to mark Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz in 1805, the structure was commissioned a year later, but not completed until the 1830s. Napoleon ordered a wooden mock-up to be put in place in 1810, and work was completely halted after the Bourbon restoration. Napoleon’s corpse eventually passed through the arch on its way to its final resting place at Les Invalides. This was not the only remarkable thing to pass through the arch: at the victory parade to mark the end of the First World War, a pilot flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch as part of the event! The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a later addition, commemorating the honoured dead and missing of the French army in the Great War."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_fur_exchange_european	"

Although the medieval sumptuary laws (that defined who could wear what) are largely ignored in Europe, the wearing of fur is often restricted to royalty and other high-status individuals: the British House of Lords sets out regulations for the fur trimming on peers’ robes, while furs are often reserved for warlords in the East. Lesser status furs are available to anyone with the money to spend.

In Europe, even artists benefited from the fur traders’ work: sable-hair brushes (actually made from a kind of weasel) are extremely good for watercolours, as they come to a fine point and hold paint well. Watercolour landscapes became very fashionable during the 18th Century, both to own and to paint. Painting watercolours became an accomplishment for marriageable young ladies, a delicate art to show off their sensibilities. In the process, watercolours became an important part of tourism, as they allowed the rich to record what they had seen on their travels."	false

A general can only do his duty properly if his bodyguard keep those rough and unpleasant fellows from interrupting his calm deliberations on how to kill as many of them as possible. Washington relies on these talented, and, more importantly, trusted men to protect him as he directs the battle. His presence on the battlefield can inspire men to fight - even in the darkest of times. 

As a young General in the colonial army, George Washington was involved in many of the key events of the French Indian War. In 1754 he marched into the Ohio Valley with 200 men to help with the construction of a series of forts along the Ohio River. Later that year he would build Fort Necessity to protect against an impeding French attack. Shortly after, he was involved in a skirmish with French troops signalling the beginning of armed hostilities in a war which would last six long years."	false

These men are professional soldiers, the best that can be found in the United States. Each man is trained to fight with guts, independence and determination. All are schooled in the tactics of formal, European fighting, where giving fire from rigid lines is the norm, yet they are also capable of fighting in a flexible, loose skirmish fashion that is ideally suited to war against the natives. The Legion may not be numerous, but it makes up for that in fighting spirit!

The Founding Fathers were very suspicious of armies and believed that a citizen militia was quite sufficient for national defence. Events proved them wrong. Formed in 1791 to fight the natives, the Legion was America’s first standing army. Under the leadership of “Mad” Anthony Wayne – so called not because he was insane, but because he was “mad for it” and always up for a fight – US units were properly trained for the first time. After Wayne was killed in 1796, his Legion was reorganised into more conventional infantry regiments, which still exist as combat units in the US Army today."	false

Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778) left his fortune to the furthering of science and culture, as befitted a part-Scottish follower of the Scottish Enlightenment. He also left money for some almshouses for the poor folk of Haarlem. Before his death he had established various learned societies in the town and, like many gentlemen of the period, had a “cabinet of curiosities”: a large collection of objects of interest or antiquarian value. His fortune, made from the cloth trade, was certainly large enough to let him indulge in his passions for science and collecting.

The museum was a reflection of his interests, and was added to over the years so that it now has a fine collection of fossils, scientific instruments (and making them was something of a Dutch speciality), coins, paintings, prints and drawings. Pieter Teyler left a charitable and worthy legacy of a “Christian gentleman” in the museum and the almshouses."	false

Their warrior spirit encourages competition, and this healthy competition encourages the warrior spirit. Trained from an early age, these men use their bows to feed their families and for protection. They are specialists in skirmish warfare, and provide assistance to the main force of the tribe, protecting against enemy skirmish attacks and harassing the foe where possible.

Historically, the Muscogee and Cherokee relationship with the European powers was a rocky one. During the French and Indian War they sided with the British, but this alliance was far from settled. As the war progressed, the conduct of British soldiers angered the Cherokee; renegade troops committed terrible crimes against Cherokee women and children when the warriors were away. This eventually prompted the Cherokee and their allies to attack the British, and their war continued until peace was declared between France and Britain in 1763. The Cherokee eventually made peace in November of that year."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_spain_academia	"

The Academy received royal approval in 1744, but it was not until the reign of Carlos III that it found a proper home in a former Baroque palace. This is somewhat surprising given that Carlos was a benevolent despot and rather fond of hunting. He was, however, also much given to public works and, more significantly for the advancement of the arts, had had a serious falling out with the anti-Enlightenment Jesuits. He suppressed the order in Spain and rendered the Spanish Inquisition largely ineffective.

The Academy included many artists of note, but surely its most distinguished master was Francisco Goya (1746-1828). Goya was supremely talented, and became the painter of choice in the Spanish court. His work marks a transition between the work of the “Old Masters” and the modern world to come: his painting “La maja desnuda” has been described as the first non-symbolic nude painting in the Western world. Sadly, he was tortured by deafness and illness in later life, and his painting took on a grimmer, darker feel.

The Academy is now home to a fine collection of paintings from the 15th Century onwards."	false

events_event_text_hydraulic_press	"The manufacturing industry has taken a giant stride forward with the announcement of a new invention by Mr Joseph Bramah, previously notable for his inventions of the ""beer engine"" and the improved water closet, amongst other equally splendid innovations.

Applying the principles of fluid dynamics within a closed system as outlined by the French mathematician Pascal, Bramah has developed a powerful new hydraulic press.

The machine uses two pistons of different sizes, linked by a sealed fluid-filled system. A small force applied to the smaller piston is translated via the fluid into a far greater force on the larger piston. This force can be brought to bear on many aspects of manufacturing process and represents the dawning of a new age: that of hydraulic engineering."	false

Though Broughton holds no official station beyond the stature due to his title, these rules have quickly found favour with proponents of the pugilistic art. Prior to this, many such encounters were little more than chaotic free-for-alls, frequently with fatal consequences. This is not to say that Broughton’s rules wholly dispense with the raw nature of proceedings - throws and falls are still permissible, rounds last for as long as both fighters remain on their feet, the number of rounds is limited only by the protagonists ability to come up to scratch in time, and no allowance is made for injuries - however serious.

Broughton’s rules are known as the ""London Prize Ring"" rules, and have set the fledgling sport on a path toward acceptability."	false

events_event_text_senefelder_lithography	"Johann Alois Senefelder, an actor and playwright from Austria, has developed a new technique that will greatly aid the process of printing.

Having experienced problems with the printing of one of his plays that caused him to get into debt, Senefelder began to experiment with ways of simplifying the process and printing his works himself. The established method of printing involves preparing a raised metal plate or stone tablet to convey the ink to the page, with preparation being both costly and time-consuming.

The new method uses an ink, acid and salt mixture - the ink adhering to a wet, raised limestone surface, whilst the acid and salt washes the rest of the plate clean. The reduced wear occurring on such flat printing plates allows for longer, more efficient print runs.

As Senefelder has used a local limestone to form his plates, the process has become known as lithography, after ""lithos"", the Greek word for stone."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_elite_light_infantry	"

Whether they are called light infantry, jaegers, tirailleurs or chasseurs à pied, it is the job of these men to screen the main battle line, harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy’s ranks. Unlike their fellows in the line infantry, light infantrymen are trained to think for themselves, use the ground and cover intelligently, and not fight in rigid lines. Instead, they form a loose skirmish line and fire independently at their own designated targets. The effect is a constant, low-level barrage rather than the crashing thunder of a volley but the effect is quite deadly as officers and sergeants are picked off and removed from the fight. Against cavalry, however, their best defence is to withdraw to their own battle line.

Historically, the Austrians were widely regarded as producing the finest light infantry forces in Europe. Other nations did catch up, but in the case of Britain and France it was their experiences in fighting in North America that persuaded them of the wisdom of light troops. Battle lines were simply impossible to manage in the dense woodlands, and largely pointless against the native tribes!"	false

start_pos_factions_description_-1190433383	"Great Britain is not a natural creation, but the marriage of separate kingdoms and peoples. The new nation has been through a century of unparalleled turbulence: an unwelcome joining of Scotland and England; religious strife; civil wars; an executed king; military dictatorship; a populist monarch restored; and the overthrow of a second king. Less than 15 years ago, the hated Catholic James II was forced into exile in the Glorious Revolution and a Protestant monarchy restored. A short, vicious war in Ireland put paid to any chance of a Catholic Stuart restoration. Nonetheless, the exiled James Stuart has sympathisers, the Jacobites, throughout Britain. Despite – or perhaps because of – this turbulent history, Britain is an engine driving the scientific and cultural advancement of northern Europe: turmoil fuels creativity.

As an island nation, Britons have always looked to, as Shakespeare puts it:

“…the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house…”

Britain’s strength lies at sea, but in trade and colonisation as much as naval power. Trade taxes pay for the navy; the navy allows unhindered trade. The English Channel keeps the French at bay and, to a lesser extent, the Dutch. With Dutchman William III on the British throne, there is ambivalence in the traditional rivalry with the Netherlands!

The English and Scots like to think that they can sleep safe, that no foreign invader or tyranny need worry them. They are partly right, but only as long as there is no centralised Continental power. A nation that can unite the resources of Europe will surely crush the dream of Albion. This, then, is the fundamental aim of Britain: to side with the weak in Europe against the strong – and steal as many overseas possessions as possible while doing it!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_ferguson_riflemen	"

Major Patrick Ferguson’s remarkable and patented flintlock rifle is a breech-loading weapon, with a cunning screw mechanism that opens the breech for loading and still seals the chamber tightly for firing. In the hands of a well-trained man, firing the piece is rapid; the laborious business of muzzle loading is no more! The rifling makes it accurate and deadly!

Historically, Ferguson intended his gun to go into the hands of an elite force, under officers of enterprise and daring, who would move rapidly, use cover, and could deliver accurate and withering fire. In practice, the weapon was not a success, because it was difficult to manufacture in quantity and somewhat fragile in the rough conditions of a battlefield: the screw mechanism would jam if not treated with respect. After Ferguson was wounded in action, his critics lost no time in equipping the unit with Brown Bess muskets, and then eventually disbanding Ferguson’s prize riflemen."	false

Reflecting the spirit of enquiry which dominates our modern age, the attraction offers a chance to behold a wide variety of creatures and botanical specimens at first-hand. In the past, collections of animals were the preserve of the wealthy gentleman’s private menagerie or of the travelling fair, and were exhibited merely as curiosities. A zoological garden was established on a more scientific footing in the grounds of the Schonbrunn Palace, Vienna in 1752, but was still a private concern.

The transference of the Royal Menagerie from Versailles to the existing botanical gardens in Paris represents an opportunity for scholars and laymen alike to observe a wide variety of creatures far from their native heath!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_east_camel_gunners	"

Like many desert troops, these men have learned the trade of killing in a hard school. The desert is unforgiving to those who are weak, and a man who cannot fight well is unlikely to survive the constant feuding and banditry that his neighbours will visit upon him. The scarcity of resources has also taught these men the value of making every shot count. When a bullet and a shot’s worth of gunpowder must be stolen, taken as loot or bought at enormous cost, a wise man makes sure that he only shoots at something he can kill.

These gunners carry very large muskets, with a bore the width of two thumbs on a grown man. Such a weapon is too large for any foot soldier to carry around in a desert, which is why these men fight as mounted infantry: riding into battle, then dismounting to deliver their devastating fire. Any wound from their weapons is likely to be fatal, even an apparently minor one in a limb: musket balls often have bubbles and flaws when they are cast which causes them to burst inside a target, causing horrendous injuries."	false

Day-to-day life for a peasant farmer has barely changed in a thousand years. It is a short, hard life of abject poverty and backbreaking labour. He can expect nothing better than to work and die in the same village, tilling the same fields, his life bounded by the same horizon. Peasant farms are not terribly efficient: the landowners have little interest in anything beyond their rents and tithes. The problem for them is that peasant economies are, by their very nature, cash poor and most income is in kind, and there is a limit to where you can spend a goat!

Historically, life for a peasant was pretty much the same all over the world: work from dawn to dusk. In Russia, the peasants were serfs tied to the land and the property of the landowner as much as any cow or goat. In India, peasants were a caste locked into their social position by hallowed custom. The system eventually broke down in Western Europe thanks to industrialization needing a constant supply of workers and changes in land usage."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_64_lber_land_cannon_elephant	"

As the name suggests, these huge guns fire cannon balls in excess of 60 pounds. The impact of such a shot crushes anyone unlucky enough to be caught, and does terrible damage to any structure hit. That canister shot can be added on top of such a ball is merely piling on the misery for the unfortunate targets. These enormous guns require large-scale support to operate effectively. Indeed, in Indian service they are often towed by elephants rather than a team of smaller draught oxen!

Historically, guns this size were difficult to cast without flaws; the size of gunpowder charge involved in firing these guns meant that any flaw would be fatal to the gunners. Secondly, there was the difficulty of moving these guns to the battlefield. Smaller artillery produced substantial trains of draught animals, additional carts for powder, spares and shot, (all with more draught animals) – and then all of these would need feeding and watering, even before the gun crews were considered. That it was considered worthwhile to produce and then use these guns with all these drawbacks shows just how destructive they were."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tribal_playable_burial_ground	"

A wide variety of burial customs are observed. Some believe that the air is important to the passing of their loved ones. Thus wooden scaffolds are created and the dead placed on top, so their spirit may pass into the wind. Others believe the spirit must be kept with the body after death and thus build ‘spirit houses’ to trap the spirit. These little wooden structures can take many forms, some even look like miniature houses standing over the body.

Burial rites are often closely tied to tribal totems: eagle-related tribes, for example,  always place their dead on scaffolding. A bear totem tribe often buries the dead in wooded areas, and so on."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_24_lber_land_cannon_(demi_cannon)	"

Although obsolete, a demi-cannon is still a dangerous weapon to face as it fires a ball with a nominal weight of around 24 pounds. This large calibre makes for a large weapon with a massive gun carriage. Once properly emplaced, a demi-cannon is hard enough to adjust for aim, let alone drag to a new location! Originally, this lack of tactical mobility was not a problem, as the gun was for siege work or for a battlefield where there was little artillery present. It was unlikely to ever suffer any kind of counter-battery fire, so didn’t need to be moved.

Artillery was sometimes incredibly dangerous to its users as well as the targets: fire was a terrible risk. The artillery baggage train usually held an enormous quantity of powder, and any stray spark was liable to cause an explosion. Anyone out of place caught near the powder train could expect little mercy: some generals ordered that enemy agents should be burned alive if caught in an arson attempt, and immediate lynching for their own errant soldiers wandering too near the artillery train!"	false

They are expected to shadow the chief at all times and, if necessary, lay down their lives to protect him. This is one of the highest honours available to a warrior, and those that are afforded it will proudly show their status.

Chiefs were often chosen for previous acts of valour and were men that other warriors respected and would follow willingly. Although chiefs held the power to make decisions in the tribe the elders had the power to overrule them on any decisions that did not focus on the good of the tribe.

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_euro_elite_light_infantry_windbuchse_jaegers	"

Windbüchsenjäger are woodsmen, hunters and poachers – men with a good grasp of field craft. Their speciality is skirmishing, to disrupt enemy formations with harassing fire, or to stop the enemy doing the same to their comrades. Unlike other light troops, however, they carry airguns. These weapons give them a distinctly unfair advantage!

Apart from the fact that is silent, with no muzzle flash or smoke, the windbüchse (“wind rifle”) has a 20-round magazine and fires as quickly as the jäger can pull the trigger. The gun can drive a ball through a plank (or a man) at 100 paces, but the velocity of shots drops as the air reservoir empties. Austrian gunsmiths have produced a deadly, if delicate, weapon in the windbüchse! However, it needs a highly trained and very fit man to use it properly: pumping up the air reservoir is a huge effort.

Historically, these airguns were not a success. They were quiet, but they did not work after rough treatment, something that was inevitable in battle. Napoleon Bonaparte hated them and decreed that any captured “assassin” with an airgun was to be executed, not treated as a soldier."	false

The tulip is a native flower of, among other places, Anatolia, and the flower has long been prized by the Ottomans. Planted in formal gardens, the design of which owes much to the Persian “paradise garden”, they are a spectacular display of shapes and colour. The layout of the gardens is intended to reflect the layout of paradise, and perfect blooms are a part of that.

Despite the insane financial speculation of “tulip mania” in Holland during the 17th Century, the tulip was not a native plant; it had arrived from the Ottoman Empire. The Dutch, however, were quite innovative when they indulged in the lunacy of tulip speculation, trading individual bulbs at ridiculously inflated prices. They even operated a “tulip futures” market on specimens that hadn’t even been planted or grown! Dishonesty was rife and eventually the speculation had to stop; the tulip market collapsed, like all financial bubbles, leaving many penniless. The tulip, fortunately, remains a popular garden plant to this day, although thankfully without the financial jiggery-pokery! Gardeners with too much money did pay high prices for tulip bulbs in the 18th Century although these were for planting, not financial speculation."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_cairo_janissaries	"

They are armed with muskets and swords, making them equally useful in the firing line or in melee. They are, however, vulnerable to cavalry as their training does not include formal drills to form square for protection. They do not wear armour, despite appearing rather old-fashioned compared to european troops.

Janissaries were always an elite group within the Ottoman military, although by the end of the eighteenth century they were no longer necessarily numbered among the best soldiers in the world. Originally, janissaries had been recruited from among Christian boy children within Ottoman lands, as troops under the direct control of the Sultan and as a counter to his more powerful vassals. The practice of taking children in this way was gradually abandoned, and by the 18th Century the janissaries were a power in their own right. The Cairo janissaries were almost exclusively recruited from among Arabic Egyptians. Turkish members of the larger corps did their best to make sure that the janissaries, and their own families, gained and kept control of the plum jobs within the Ottoman administration. As a result, they ceased to be a purely military force and became a highly conservative group, determined to fight any reform within the Empire that reduced their influence."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_barawardi	"

Equipped with helmets and cuirasses, they also carry swords. Their charge is not particularly powerful, but they can give a very good account of themselves in melee. Like other light cavalry, barawardi can be used to ride down skirmishers and disorganised enemies. If properly handled, they may well be able to close with artillery units without suffering too many casualties. However, they should not be committed against heavier cavalry forces, as they will suffer disproportionate losses, and require exceptional luck, or a very good commander, to be able to break an infantry square.

Cavalry was the most important element in Mughal armies, and it seems likely that all cavalrymen were well-trained fighters - expected to be physically fit and proficient horsemen. Men served in ethnically-based units, so Afghans would fight under Afghan officers, Rajputs with their own, and so on. This naturally created unit camaraderie and cohesion, because men were unlikely to let their own kith and kin die unduly. The cavalry were, however, not always trusted: their mounts would be branded with both imperial and the unit commander’s marks. This was to stop soldiers selling their good horses and enlisting as infantrymen, or from substituting inferior horseflesh. With harsh laws to punish thieves, there was therefore no market for horses carrying army marks."	false

The Academie des Sciences are so impressed that they have agreed to display the automaton, and Monsieur Vaucanson has started work on his next machine, a mechanical tambourine player. Word has it that the inventor is also preparing to unveil his masterpiece - a mechanical animal complete with a digestion system no less! Eugh!"	false

start_pos_factions_description_-2042135816	"The United Provinces are a Protestant stronghold in North-western Europe, a place where science, trade and freedom of thought have flourished since the Spanish were driven out in the last century. Having tamed their land and held back the sea, the Dutch have also embraced the sea and become the foremost naval power in the world. A mere generation ago, the Dutch navy sailed into the Thames and burned the English fleet at anchor: this kind of bravado and expertise is not quickly forgotten.

Dutch merchantmen range across the world’s oceans, and the wealth of the world passes through Dutch ports. Dutchmen can be found trading in the Indies, where they give the locals a run for their money, and the Caribbean. They are everywhere, in fact, where there is a profit to be made. Spanish claims to the New World and its trade are cheerfully ignored, as are Spanish threats. The Dutch have learned to live with Hapsburg threats hanging over their heads. Having beaten off brutal attempts to bring them to heel, the Dutch now have little love for Hapsburg-ruled Spain or Austria. A distant Catholic emperor holds no appeal for them. An expansionist France, on the other hand, does bear watching, and guarding against.

Other rivals close at hand are now less of a threat than they used to be. The British have been… tamed is too strong a word… brought to their senses by having a good, honest Dutchman on their throne. William III of Orange was an acceptable Protestant ruler for the British when they needed one. His presence has done much to calm relations, especially as the equally-mercantile British have designs on world trade that should rightfully be Dutch!

For the future, the Dutch have much to be hopeful about. They have a strong navy, and a tradition of victory. There is wealth aplenty in every corner of the world, if only the Dutch have the will to go and take it!"	false

battles_description_battle_of_porto_novo	"Because it took a long time for messages and ships to reach India from Europe, British Royal Navy admirals often found themselves having to make do with inferior forces against superior French forces, no orders and no reinforcements.

Vice-Admiral George Pocock found himself in this situation in 1759 during the Seven Years War. His smaller and less powerful force had already fought two indecisive battles with a French fleet under the Comte ďAché.

He would now have to fight once again. This time, however, Pocock would be on the offensive near the French base at Pondicherry. If he could beat the French, control over the Indian Ocean would pass to the Royal Navy, and the French would have to withdraw. Pondicherry would almost certainly fall, and the French would no longer have a base in India. 

Take control of Pocock’s outnumbered and outgunned fleet as you seek the defeat of the French. Historically, this battle ended indecisively on a tactical level, but the advantage went to the British and gave them control of the Indian Ocean."	false

events_event_text_bonnet_hanged	"So named due to his background of moderate wealth through landownership, the ""Gentleman Pirate"" - Stede Bonnet, an associate of Blackbeard amongst others - has been captured and executed for buccaneering in the Caribbean.

Already pardoned by the Governor of North Carolina, and issued a letter of marque to privateer against the Spanish, Bonnet soon returned to piracy in 1718. The Governor of South Carolina tasked Colonel William Rhett with bringing Bonnet and his crew to justice. Rhett came upon Bonnet’s ship whilst it was being repaired on the Cape Fear River. A furious battle ensued that lasted several hours before the massively outnumbered pirates surrendered.

After being held for three weeks, Bonnet was sentenced to death on two counts of piracy following the betrayal of a crew member who turned King's Evidence against him in return for the sparing of his own life. As a last resort, Bonnet wrote to the Governor of South Carolina to ask for clemency - a move which proved fruitless as the Governor endorsed the Judge’s decision, and Bonnet was hanged without delay."	false

technologies_long_description_military_ordnance_quicklime_shells	"

Quicklime is a dangerous, caustic product that gets very, very hot when it is slaked with water. It does have entirely innocent uses: plaster, mortar and whitewash for buildings, and in glass making; but as a weapon it is frightening indeed. The smallest amount will cause painful, even fatal, burns on exposed flesh. The eyes are especially vulnerable because they are moist with tears. Quicklime shells carry an explosive charge so as to burst above enemy lines, but they are still dangerous to the gunners using them.

Historically, quicklime had a long history of use in warfare, dating back to Classical antiquity. This did not make it an acceptable weapon in the eyes of many military gentlemen who, quite rightly, realised that what could be used against the enemy could also be used against them. Further, like all chemical weapons, it was entirely dependent on the wind to send the caustic agent in the right direction once released. It was true that, short of running away, there was no practical defence against perfidious and odious chemical weapons."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_rights_of_man	"

Every man deserves rights, regardless of his nationality, class or any other categorization placed upon him by his fellow man. These rights should extend to anything that does no injury to others.  Any law imposed should only have the power to prevent these things, and nothing else. These are the new ideas implicit in the Rights of Man. Theorists believe law is an expression of the general will and as such should not be controlled by a single individual.

Historically, Thomas Paine (1737-1809), an English revolutionary who was involved in both the American and French Revolutions, wrote the “Rights of Man”. His work supported and advanced the ideals behind both revolutions: he had a strong belief in the need for freedom of speech. He stated that a man should never be punished for his views and should be free to voice them to the masses. In a time when some of his fellows were persecuted for publishing radical theories this was a dangerous view point indeed. Paine is still regarded as a hero to this day."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_12_lber_land_cannon_galloper	"

Horse artillery units are distinguished from other types of artillery forces because everyone rides into battle: drivers ride the horses, while gun crews are often given seats on the gun limbers. The cannons assigned to horse artillery units usually fire relatively small calibre rounds although, as always, the weight of shot is used to designate different horse artillery types. The weight of fire is considered to be less important than the speed with which it can be moved to a firing position, deployed, and then removed to a new site. This is what gives horse artillery its appeal to generals: the ability to rapidly give fire from almost anywhere on the battlefield. Horse artillery can be used as a flexible reserve, or to exploit a weakness in an enemy line.

Historically, in many countries horse artillery developed a cavalry-like air of being an elite force. This attitude is entirely understandable. Dragging heavy artillery pieces across country at the gallop is an inherently dangerous thing to do, even without people shooting at you!"	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_east_sipahi_cavalry	"

They are unswervingly faithful and proudly deserving of their elite status. Mounted on the finest horseflesh, they carry ornate lances into battle which are deadly when brought to bear at the charge. When delivered in the flanks or rear of an enemy formation, such a charge often proves decisive to the course of a battle.

As fief-holders, Sipahis are granted the income from a parcel of land in exchange for their military service, and they are also expected to supply a number of armed men. Highly disciplined and enjoying the high status common to many cavalry corps, Sipahis see themselves as superior to the sometimes unruly Janissaries, with whom they maintain a simmering rivalry. A contributing factor to this is that Sipahis are all ethnic Turks, whereas the Janissaries are of mixed stock, recruited as children from provincial Christian families and converted to the Islamic faith. Regardless of these petty concerns, Sipahis represent the best horsemen available to the Sublime Porte."	false

The centre-piece of this attraction is a large ring, which affords uninterrupted views of the trick riders as they complete their circuits at the gallop. Late of the Fifteenth Light Dragoon Regiment, Mr Astley is an astute entrepreneur.

Rumours abound that he will soon be adding other attractions to the repertoire such as clowns, acrobats, musicians and jugglers; and perhaps seeking to establish his ""circuses"" in other prominent capitals."	false

events_event_text_jack_sheppard_hanged	"After leading the thief-takers a merry dance for over two years the robber and burglar ""Gentleman Jack"" Sheppard has danced his last - and the Tyburn Jig no less!

Following five arrests and four sensational escapes, the rogue was finally captured and held in the Middle Stone Room at the very centre of Newgate, where he was constantly observed and loaded down with three hundred pounds of weights to ensure he remained in captivity. Such was the talk of Sheppard in society circles that his gaolers were able to charge a full four shillings to see him.

Sheppard refused to inform on his associates in return for a more lenient sentence, and despite petitions for the death sentence to be commuted to transportation for life, it was passed on 10th November. Unfortunately the slight build that had aided so many of his escapes made Sheppard's hanging a slow and painful strangulation. After fifteen minutes Jack Sheppard's corpse was cut down, leading to a surge amongst the crowd, who feared his body would be taken for dissection.

Mauled and mutilated, his corpse was later recovered and buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_national_debt	"

Kings have always run up debts, borrowing money (sometimes at sword’s point) from subjects and great banking houses. The debt, however, was the personal responsibility of the king. Eventually, his credit would run out. The concept of national debt allows a nation to borrow to finance expansion and conquest. Wars can be financed by issuing bills and bonds, and to be repaid – probably – from taxation.

Scottish economist, gambler and rake John Law (1671-1729) made several advances in his field, his most notable being the introduction of the French national bank. He also proposed state control over national finances and trade. As a result, the state used all national profits to pay off national debt. Eventually, his schemes collapsed but in the process he gave the Western world bank notes and the word “millionaire”.

National debt could also be a dangerous thing, for government officials. When the share trading of the “South Sea Bubble” spectacularly failed in 1720, government creditors were out of pocket because they had been paid off in shares. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Aislabie, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for his incompetence"	false

Combining in the main drunken debauchery with occasional instances of occult ritual, the club meets at the recently acquired ruins of Medmenham Abbey, near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.

There are twelve regular members in addition to Dashwood - ""gentlemen"" all - and many other regular guests in attendance also. On one occasion, after much quaffing and reprehensible behaviour, the ""Franciscans"" decided to say a prayer to the Devil. Politician John Wilkes, one of the twelve, decided to mock this aspect of their gatherings by dressing a baboon in red - complete with horns - and releasing it from a cupboard at the speaking of Dashwood’s satanic incantations. The beast proceeded to leap onto the back of Lord Sandwich, who in fear and shock exclaimed ""Spare me gracious Devil! Spare a wretch who was never your servant! I am but half a sinner!""

Let’s face it: that is not the sort of thing one can live down easily, and needless to say Sandwich and Dashwood were not amused. However, it wasn’t long before they were up to their usual debauched tricks once again. Where will it all end?"	false

These cavalrymen, armed with lances, have a devastating charge, which is especially effective against enemy line infantry. Pulaski’s Legion is best employed to rush and break the enemy line, and then it should be pulled back for another charge before the enemy regains their senses. Despite their great initial attack, a wise commander will avoid leaving them in melee, as they are extremely vulnerable in prolonged close-combat.

Pulaski’s Legion was created by a Pole, Casmir Pulaski. He was forced to flee Poland after being implicated in a plot to kill the king; it was during his exile in Paris that Pulaski met Benjamin Franklin. Franklin convinced him to aid the emerging American army against the British, and Pulaski joined Washington’s army just before the battle of Brandywine. During the battle he led a scouting mission that discovered the British flanking movement. This act alone earned him the position of brigadier general of the American cavalry."	false

events_event_text_shakespeare_festival	"The inaugural Shakespeare Jubilee has taken place in Stratford-upon-Avon to celebrate the playwright’s two hundredth anniversary.

Organised by the famous actor David Garrick - also a theatre manager and former pupil and friend of Dr Samuel Johnson - the festival has been the focus of much frenzied excitement. Fancy dress balls, salutes by cannon, serenades, recitations, poems and even a Shakespearean Cup horserace have featured, whilst commemorative medals have also been struck, pageants laid on, and fireworks displayed.

As well as promoting a love of Shakespeare, Garrick has done well for himself financially-speaking, selling special editions of Shakespeare’s plays at two shillings each - no doubt seen as a fair way to recover his expenditure from repairing Stratford Town Hall!

Oddly though, none of the Bard’s actual plays were performed during the celebrations, though Garrick is working on a much-anticipated play entitled ""The Jubilee"" for London audiences unable to attend the main event. Above all, Garrick has pulled off a massive public relations coup, placing not just Shakespeare, but also himself, firmly in the public eye for some time to come."	false

events_event_text_downing_street	"The First Lord of the Treasury - leader of the government of Great Britain - has moved into a new residence at Number 10, Downing Street, Westminster.

The house was until recently three buildings: a ""house at the back"" once adjoining the old Whitehall Palace, and two smaller ramshackle residences, one until recently occupied by the amusingly-named Mr Chicken, who has since been moved on - the other being the aforementioned Number 10.

Following an extensive refit and redecoration under the guidance of prestigious architect William Kent, the buildings have truly been given a new lease of life.

The Monarch originally offered the property to the First Lord as a personal gift for services to the nation, but he has accepted only on condition that it be a gift to the office of First Lord and not himself specifically, so successive holders of the highest office would also be able to live there."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_steam_engine_factory_indian	"

Steam engines can drive all manner of machines, from trip hammers to crushing mills, spinning machines to looms, lathes, drills and a hundred other devices. Anything that once relied on muscle power can be connected to a steam engine by a cunning contrivance of pulleys and drive shafts. Once an operator no longer provides mechanical power for a machine, he can either supervise many machines, or his job can be made less skilled. Either way, he does more work for his wages, and the mill owner feels the benefit. Because the heavy work is now done by machine, it is also possible for women and children to make a contribution to the workforce.

The “dark Satanic mills” that William Blake (1757-1827) wrote about and drew in his epic work “Jerusalem” (worked on 1804-20) really were shocking to everyone who encountered them. No matter where the mills and factories were built, they changed the landscape, poisoned rivers and skies, and brought new slums in their shadows. For sensitive people like Blake they truly were a vision of a new Hell on Earth, destroying lives in the search for profit."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_spain_palacio_real_de_madrid	"

Originally a Moorish fortress when Madrid was ruled by the Islamic emir of Cordoba, and then a castle under the stewardship of the Christian kings of Castile, the site was not regularly used as a royal residence. The Antiguo Alcázar or Old Castle dated back to the 16th Century, but this burned down on Christmas Eve, 1734.

King Philip V, the first of the Bourbon rulers of Spain, ordered a new palace to be constructed. Perhaps he had it in mind to create a rival to Versailles, the palace of his grandfather, Louis XIV of France. In the event, he died before the construction work was complete and never lived in the New Palace, as it was only in 1764 that Carlos III occupied the building. As a setting for a monarchy, however, the palace had been well worth waiting for! It is vast: with 2800 rooms it is far bigger than any other European palace. 

It is still the official residence of the Spanish monarchy, although it is only used for state occasions."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_earthworks_indian	"

By European standards, this fortress looks like something of a relic from an earlier age, but to underestimate the defences would be very foolish. Packed earth ramparts behind the thick, high walls not only give extra fighting space to the defenders, but also deaden enemy cannon fire, absorbing the impact of shot and shell. Any attacker attempting to breach the defences must be prepared for a long siege, followed by a bloody and dangerous assault.

Historically, some of the most impressive fortifications ever constructed were the product of the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The quality of workmanship demanded was extremely high, even palatial in its luxurious attention to detail. The Red Fort at Agra remains an outstanding example of Mughal architecture, a fusion of native Indian, Persian and Islamic styles that remains impressive even today. Over 3000 people lived within its walls at one point, and the defences were certainly capable of protecting many more."	false

Former Harvard alumni have contributed books from their personal libraries to create the library for this new school of divinity.

The Collegiate School was intended to remain a beacon of puritan thought in an increasingly unorthodox world, and in 1718 the governors contacted a man named Elihu Yale for further funding. The devout Yale, a Welsh businessman and philanthropist, had £560 to contribute from his trading successes with the East India Company, over four hundred books of his own and a portrait of the King - all which he gave gladly.

The school’s name-change was mooted as an encouragement for further investment, but sadly when news of the change reached Yale’s family in Wales he had already died - whilst on a further business trip to India."	false

There is no greater measure of a man than how he handles himself in warfare; it is an honourable pursuit for a Native American. When needed, peasants and farmers can take up arms to fight for survival, but real warriors are needed if there is to be any proper defence against invaders. A warrior society instils a sense of courage and honour in the tribe’s fighters, as well as laying the groundwork for training in the arts of ambushing.

Warrior societies played an important role in tribal life. They provided warriors with a social structure and gave them prestige within the tribe. Each society had its own distinctive rituals and encouraged bravery through rivalry with other societies and the promise of higher society rank. Although these positions provided great respect and privileges they also came with huge personal sacrifices for an individual. A ‘bear-belt wearer’ in the Big Dog Society of the Crow, for example, was expected to walk straight up to the enemy during battle and never, ever retreat no matter what happened."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_top_gallants	"

All sailing ships rely on the wind for motive power. The only practical way to make a better speed through the water at a particular wind velocity is to put on more sail. Each mast is designed to take a main sail and a topsail, but it is possible with top gallants to add an extra sail above the topsail. Naturally, this requires more yards, ropes and skilled sailors to set the sails. Adding a top gallant is also something of a strain on the fabric of the ship: the extra strain on a mast can, in high winds, rip it right out of a hull. This catastrophic damage to the whole ship can also cause casualties among the crew.

The speed and handling of a ship can also be improved by careening the hull: a process that takes days. This, however, is not something that will instantly give more speed, unlike setting the topgallants."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_classical_economics	"

Classical economics seeks to change the way a nation’s wealth is considered. No longer is the amount of money in a king’s treasury the sole measurement of national wealth. The earnings of the populace are now taken into account. With this step forward people leave feudal society and step forward as individuals seeking their own gains for their own benefit.

Classical economics was eventually superseded. Its influence does still linger however, especially within the modern school of thought known as “new classical economics.”

Historically, the school of classical economics was originally created by Scottish philosopher Adam Smith, but David Ricardo is leading the school forward in its beliefs and methods. His debates on such topics as the Corn Laws with Thomas Malthus are giving theorists much to consider. One of the key questions the theory seeks to answer is: how can a society be built upon a system where man seeks to further only his own interests"	false

No matter what his title – Lord Lieutenant (to the monarch), Governor, Pasha, Thalur – the man appointed to oversee a province is a minor monarch, even in a republic! His main duties are tax raising and defence, and he is the government’s man rather than a senior member of the local community.  He is both protector and enforcer. He can enforce the law as he sees fit, ignore it when inconvenient and even grant pardons. He can impress men into military service and use them against any who dare to rebel. He has the power of life and death over his subjects – although he may have to use the justice system rather than simply having people shot. And, best of all, in an age of “interest” he has the power to fill his own and his friends’ purses at the state’s expense.

Historically, office holders in the 18th Century (almost regardless of country or government style) seemed to have trouble keeping the state’s money out of their own pockets. It was acceptable for a man to appoint himself or a friend as a contractor, tax farmer or monopolist and make a handsome profit."	false

The Mescalero Apache are a mountain people and, unusually for such a folk, highly skilled riders. Masters of irregular warfare, they have an intimate knowledge of the landscape, and concealment skills that give them an edge over enemies. The Mescalero Apache take full advantage of the environment, and recognise the importance of subterfuge and diversions when fighting a larger enemy force.

They even create fake camps, climb sheer rock faces to leave no trail, and live off the land, all to confound enemy trackers. Their horses are not only for hunting and battle, but are also eaten when food is scarce.

The Mescalero Apache lived among the mountains of New Mexico and Texas. The heart of their homeland was the peak of the Sierra Blanca. Their name originates from their use of the century mescal plant, a reliable source of food that can be found in the deserts of New Mexico. The tribe harvested the plant’s heart and cooked it by steaming. Today the plant is used in a very different form: it is distilled to create mescal, a spirit closely related to tequila."	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_circassian_armoured_cavalry	"

These cavalrymen may look like they have ridden out of a storybook, or be fighting Crusader knights, but they are superb horsemen and can deliver a shocking charge against an unwary enemy. If this does not break a foe’s line, they can then fight in melee with their sabres until they do win! Armour and weight, however, do not help much when facing the cannons’ blast or when trying to break into a well-formed infantry square.

The people of the Caucasus Mountains have a long tradition of producing beautiful women and brave and skilled fighters. Circassian ladies were highly regarded for their looks, intelligence, and spirit, and were considered very desirable concubines by the Ottomans. Circassian men had centuries of experience of fighting invaders and each other. They were also extremely set in their ways: they produced fine and beautiful weapons and armour in, as might be expected, somewhat conservative and traditionalist designs. Armoured cavalrymen from the Caucasus were in Russian service as well as in the Ottoman army, and were rightly regarded as an asset, not an archaic burden."	false

These volunteers are recruited from among the braver colonists. They are well equipped and know their local terrain, but at the end of the day they have farms, workshops and stores that need tending. They do not spend all their time drilling and training, and so cannot match European infantry in rate of fire, accuracy or morale.

 In the early days of the colonies, what little presence the government had could not be relied on for defence, and militia were all that stood between the colonists and annihilation. A proud tradition of volunteering for service was established early; the tradition was maintained during the American Revolution, and came to be enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."	false

events_event_text_loves_of_mars_and_venus	"A performance by the dancer and choreographer John Weaver has heralded the introduction of a new dance variant to Britain.

In his ""Loves of Mars and Venus"", the author of ""A Collection of Ball dances used at Court"" and ""A Small Treatise of Time and Cadence in Dancing"" uses a wide variety of gestures and movement to depict a classical storyline without any use of the spoken word whatsoever. Their dance to convey such narrative and emotion is a style known as ""ballet"" - the French word for ""beautiful dance"". Prior to this, dance performances have been more a source of amusement than a serious art-form, with Weaver himself known for more comedic styles such as pantomime.

However, the obvious connections between ballet and the more accepted forms of artistic expression such as drama, music and literature are such that it is rapidly coming to be seen as a very serious matter."	false

technologies_long_description_military_navy_reformed_naval_administration	"

Traditionally, many naval nations have relied on treating a navy as one more part of the royal household, or a series of temporary arrangements that draw on the merchant fleets in time of war. A reformation of the navy’s shore administration replaces the ad hoc arrangements of previous centuries with a properly trained and salaried secretariat, men who understand the worlds of business, account books and legal matters better than they know the sea. It is they who organise and run the naval service not, as was once the case, admirals and officers too old or crippled to walk the quarterdeck. The change, while bemoaned by sea officers, is undoubtedly necessary to ensure that a fleet can remain at sea, with crews, food and equipment as required, and shore facilities for repair when they are needed, wherever they are needed. 

Historically, maintaining maritime power was not an option for any nation that engaged in overseas trade. The only guarantee that sea lanes would be open for merchant vessels was the guns of a powerful navy. A nation without warships was, sooner or later, a nation without its own trading fleets."	false

events_event_text_voltaic_pile	"In a letter to the Royal Society in London, the Italian scientist Count Alessandro Volta has unveiled the results of his experiments with electricity, including details of a curious device capable of storing and releasing a steady electrical charge.

The device, known as the ‘Voltaic Pile’, consists of alternating discs of copper and zinc separated by cardboard discs soaked in salt water. The metals, in combination with the conductive properties of the salt solution, produce an electrical charge. Volta hypothesises that this process is due to ""contact electrification"" - a form of static electricity.

Though many questions remain unanswered, there can be no doubt that the Voltaic pile represents a vital step toward our understanding and mastering of that strange force electricity, and long may Count Volta’s work continue to this advantageous end!"	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tribal_playable_chiefs_lodge	"

A Chief’s lodge is not only home to the man’s whole family, and one family could live in the lodge for many years as the position was passed down from father to son. The chief presides over many matters, and is expected to give every one his best attention.

In some tribes a chief’s standing was denoted by the length and number of feathers in his ‘war bonnet.’ These were earned for acts of bravery on behalf of the tribe. Eagle feathers had a deep symbolism attached to them and if a chief had any he was a great man indeed!"	false
technologies_long_description_military_army_ring_bayonet	"

The ring bayonet serves to turn a musket into a short, and rather heavy, pike. This is considerably more threatening to enemies than using the weapon as a clumsy club in a hand-to-hand fight. The bayonet is a push fit, and it is the tightness of the ring around the bayonet that keeps it in place, most of the time. Ring bayonets can be pulled off in the heat of combat by becoming wedged in enemy flesh, and they can be pushed back along the barrel. They are, however, a considerable advance over the plug bayonet.

There is some dispute over the origin of the ring bayonet, and it may be the case that several military men in different countries developed it at almost the same time. Its advantage over the plug bayonet – the user could still give fire – made sure that it was popular. A ring bayonet was not offset from the barrel, making it awkward to reload a musket with one fitted."	false

building_description_texts_long_description_opera_house_european	"

No expense is spared on making an opera house a grand venue. An opera house rivals many great palaces with the luxury of its fixtures and fittings, as these public areas for the audience are more important than the entertainment. Theatrical contrivances and mechanical tricks may make the staging as grand as the music, but for the elite it is the gossip, plotting and backbiting that is the real pleasure of a night at the opera.

In the 18th Century opera was done in the Italian “serious” style, a musical form that influenced many non-Italian composers including Mozart. The plots were intentionally simple, based on Classical themes, usually tragic and often had a highly conservative bent – as befitted the tastes of the patrons paying for the music. Many are still performed today. One fashion that has (mercifully) ended is the use of castrati singers: young men gelded so that their voices did not break and remained in the soprano range."	false

technologies_long_description_enlightenment_government_by_consent	"

Society is built on a series of laws and understandings: no man can be governed unless he deems those in power worthy of his respect, or capable of upholding his interests. This, in essence, is government by consent. Follows of this theory think rulers should never have the right to force any beliefs on those they rule. If the rulers don’t have the consent of the masses they can be overthrown and replaced by others chosen by the masses.

Historically, philosopher John Locke spent many years musing about government, and the correct way to govern a society in order to preserve the rights of the individual. His thoughts culminated in his work “The two treaties of government.”  Each of these outlined his thoughts on traditional forms of government, and his suggestions on how things could be improved."	false
