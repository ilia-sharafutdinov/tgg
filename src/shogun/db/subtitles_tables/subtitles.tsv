"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_01"	"After the battle of Sekigahara the Tokugawa Shogunate dominated Japan."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_02"	"Those who fought Tokugawa Ieyasu became the “Tozama”, the outsiders."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_03"	"Disgraced, the Tozama daimyo and their descendants were forever excluded from positions of power."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_04"	"Instead, they looked abroad, prospering through commerce with China and the West."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_05"	"Threatened by the newly-wealthy Tozama, Tokugawa Iemitsu, grandson of Ieyasu, closed the ports of Japan, banning all foreign trade."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_06"	"For over 200 years Japan remained isolated. With no enemies, the power of the Shogunate waned."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_07"	"Then, in 1853, a fleet of American warships forced open the ports of Japan. The Shogun was humiliated."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_08"	"Revolutionary ideas and machines from the West began to flood the country."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_09"	"With the Shogun's position weakened, his enemies begin to circle."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_INTRO_10"	"The Tozama daimyo, even the Emperor himself, see the chance to bring down the Tokugawa and rule Japan."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_01"	"Takamori and his Imperial allies succeeded in extinguishing the last embers of Tokugawa support on the 17th May 1869."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_02"	"A new government was formed, with the Emperor Meiji as its head."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_03"	"The Meiji government made sweeping reforms."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_04"	"The samurai lost their privileges in society, and the power and domains of the daimyo were abolished."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_05"	"Japan abandoned its policy of international isolation and rapidly became a modern nation."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_06"	"However, many traditionalists were resentful, and they had a powerful figurehead to rally around."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_07"	"Eight years after the Meiji restoration, the great samurai Saigo Takamori rebelled."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_08"	"Initially successful, the rebels were hopelessly outnumbered and were soon pushed back to Satsuma."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_09"	"On a hillside with his few remaining men, Takamori made his final stand. Surrounded by thousands of government troops, he died a warrior’s death."
"FALL_HISTORICAL_OUTRO_10"	"Saigo Takamori would be remembered as the last of the samurai."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_01"	"After the Sengoku Jidai, peace reigned for 200 years."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_02"	"In Kyoto, the Emperor continued as divine head of state…"
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_03"	"… but real power was held by the Tokugawa Shogunate."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_04"	"For two centuries they ruled with absolute authority."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_05"	"Japan prospered.  The people were content."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_06"	"In 1853, American warships changed everything."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_07"	"The Shogun abandoned his people and signed the Treaty of Peace and Amity.  The gates to Japan were open."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_08"	"Trade was established, but the agreements favoured the western powers."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_09"	"The economy faltered and the people suffered."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_10"	"In 1863, the Emperor overruled the Shogun.   "
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_11"	"An Imperial decree ordered the expulsion of all western powers."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_12"	"No longer would Japan be westernized.  The time had come to strike back."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_13"	"The western powers gave their answer."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_14"	"The treacherous westerners brought death to our people."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_15"	"The Shogun no longer commanded respect or loyalty.  Imperial rule had to be restored."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_16"	"To strengthen our position, the Emperor made peace with the British."
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_17"	"We will study their ways and discover their secrets.  Only then can we destroy the Shogun and return honour to Japan.  "
"FALL_INTRO_EMPEROR_18"	"The Emperor must be victorious."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_01"	"After the Sengoku Jidai, peace reigned for 200 years."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_02"	"In Kyoto, the Emperor continued as divine head of state…"
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_03"	"… but real power was held by the Tokugawa Shogunate."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_04"	"For two centuries they ruled with absolute authority. "

"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_06"	"In 1854, American warships changed everything."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_07"	"The Shogun welcomed the west and signed the Treaty of Peace and Amity.  The gates to Japan were open. "
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_08"	"Trade was established, but the agreements favoured the western powers."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_09"	"The economy faltered and the people suffered."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_10"	"In 1863, the Emperor overruled the Shogun.   "
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_11"	"An Imperial decree ordered the expulsion of all western powers."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_12"	"Ten years of diplomacy, cast into the sea."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_13"	"The western powers gave their answer."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_14"	"The Emperor brought death to his people."
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_15"	"The Imperialists would pay for their misguided actions.  Order had to be restored.  "
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_16"	"To strengthen our position, the Shogun allied with the French.  "
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_17"	"We will study their ways and discover their secrets.  Only then can we destroy the fools around the Emperor and return honour to Japan.  "
"FALL_INTRO_SHOGUN_18"	"The Shogun must be victorious."
"FALL_LOSE_EMPEROR_01"	"Petals peel away, From the chrysanthemum throne. To reveal, nothing. "
"FALL_LOSE_SELF_01"	"Everything given. In honours glorious name. Gone, lost forever."
"FALL_LOSE_SHOGUN_01"	"The brave warrior. How will he be remembered? The poets decide. "
"FALL_REALMDIV_EMPEROR_01"	"Each clan has chosen their destiny."
"FALL_REALMDIV_EMPEROR_02"	"We will serve the Emperor with strength and honour."
"FALL_REALMDIV_EMPEROR_03"	"Friends will become enemies and enemies, friends, but these broken promises no longer concern us."
"FALL_REALMDIV_EMPEROR_04"	"For there remains but two fates – those who find glory, and those who invite death and oblivion."
"FALL_REALMDIV_EMPEROR_05"	"Imperial strength will be restored.  The Emperor will be victorious."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SELF_01"	"Like crops in the sun, our people grow strong."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SELF_02"	"A new power has risen."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SELF_03"	"From this day we serve our own destiny."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SELF_04"	"No Shogun, no Emperor… we will rule Japan!"
"FALL_REALMDIV_SHOGUN_01"	"Each clan has chosen their destiny."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SHOGUN_02"	"We will serve the Shogun with strength and honour."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SHOGUN_03"	"Friends will become enemies and enemies, friends, but these broken promises no longer concern us."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SHOGUN_04"	"For there remains but two fates – those who find glory, and those who invite death and oblivion."
"FALL_REALMDIV_SHOGUN_05"	"Order will be restored.  The Shogun will be victorious."
"FALL_WIN_EMPEROR_01"	"Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price."
"FALL_WIN_EMPEROR_02"	"We have paid that price and now, we reap the rewards!"
"FALL_WIN_EMPEROR_03"	"The time of the Shogun is over."
"FALL_WIN_EMPEROR_04"	"All hail the mighty Emperor!"
"FALL_WIN_SELF_01"	"Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price."
"FALL_WIN_SELF_02"	"We have paid that price and now, we reap the rewards!"
"FALL_WIN_SELF_03"	"We stand proud! The rulers of all Japan!"
"FALL_WIN_SELF_04"	"All hail our mighty leader!"
"FALL_WIN_SHOGUN_01"	"Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price."
"FALL_WIN_SHOGUN_02"	"We have paid that price and now, we reap the rewards!"
"FALL_WIN_SHOGUN_03"	"The Emperor and his minions have been cast down!"
"FALL_WIN_SHOGUN_04"	"All hail the mighty Shogun!"
"FSM_CHO_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_CHO_10"	"But we are master warriors too. Our archers are admired by all. "
"FSM_CHO_11"	"No arrow flies truer than a Chosokabe shaft."
"FSM_CHO_12"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_CHO_13"	"All will bow to the Chosokabe clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_CHO_14"	"Destiny calls!"
"FSM_CHO_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_CHO_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "
"FSM_CHO_4"	"Now the over-mighty clans no longer obey."
"FSM_CHO_5"	"The time has come for a new warlord to become shogun."
"FSM_CHO_6"	"But who will be victorious?  "
"FSM_CHO_7"	"Chosokabe lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_CHO_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_CHO_9"	"This is our land. We respect its ways. Our farmers work hard, and grow more than other men."
"FSM_DAT_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_DAT_10"	"Our warriors are feared. Their skills with the no-dachi are unrivalled. In battle, they terrify the foe!"
"FSM_DAT_11"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_DAT_12"	"All will bow to the Date clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_DAT_13"	"Destiny calls!"
"FSM_DAT_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_DAT_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "

"FSM_DAT_7"	"Date lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_DAT_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_DAT_9"	"We do not walk the same path as other clans. We are revered as strong, independent, and brave in battle."
"FSM_GEM_01"	"The Sengoku Jidai was a time of war. But those who say Japan has never seen the like have short memories. Long before the Ashikaga Shogunate, 400 years of peace were shattered by the Gempei War."
"FSM_GEM_02"	"Amaterasu, the sun goddess, watched over the emperors of Japan and gave them power."
"FSM_GEM_03"	"Their authority was absolute. An emperor could retire from the world and still have complete mastery over Japan."
"FSM_GEM_04"	"But now, imperial might is crumbling, weakened by three noble families."
"FSM_GEM_05"	"For many years, the Taira have secretly controlled the imperial court. Sophisticated, cunning, ruthless: they plot against any challengers to their hidden power. "
"FSM_GEM_06"	"The Minamoto are proud warriors. Their pleasure is battle: that, and the destruction of their enemies."
"FSM_GEM_07"	"The Fujiwara were once the most powerful family in Japan, but now they only dream of power."
"FSM_GEM_08"	"After years of careful planning the Taira are finally ready to make their move."
"FSM_GEM_09"	"The Minamoto intend to block with all their might."
"FSM_GEM_10"	"Meanwhile, the Fujiwara watch, and wait.  Perhaps this moment is a chance to right wrongs..."
"FSM_GEM_11"	"The imperial peace is at an end. War is coming and blood will flow!"
"FSM_HOJ_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_HOJ_10"	"Strong walls: strong souls."
"FSM_HOJ_11"	"Our siege engines are equally mighty! Nothing stands before them!"
"FSM_HOJ_12"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_HOJ_13"	"All will bow to the Hojo clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_HOJ_14"	"Destiny calls!"
"FSM_HOJ_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_HOJ_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "
"FSM_HOJ_4"	"Now the over-mighty clans no longer obey."
"FSM_HOJ_5"	"The time has come for a new warlord to become shogun."
"FSM_HOJ_6"	"But who will be victorious?  "
"FSM_HOJ_7"	"Hojo lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_HOJ_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_HOJ_9"	"Our castles are strong, the envy of Japan. We are rightly admired as master builders."
"FSM_IGA_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_IGA_2"	"The other clans fight."
"FSM_IGA_3"	"But not all clans play by the same rules."
"FSM_IGA_4"	"One embraces the darkness."
"FSM_IGA_5"	"One embraces the shadows."
"FSM_IGA_6"	"The Hattori are silent, deadly."
"FSM_IGA_7"	"The Ashikaga Shogunate has much to fear.  "
"FSM_IGA_8"	"Now is the time for the Hattori to reveal themselves and take their rightful place. "
"FSM_IKO_1"	"Fifteen forty-five.  This is Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_IKO_10"	"Soon, the shogun in Kyoto himself will shake as he hears us approach!"
"FSM_IKO_11"	"Now the faithful will rise and claim their rightful dues! Our foes will fall, crushed by their own sins!"
"FSM_IKO_12"	"We wait no longer! Fate marches with us!"
"FSM_IKO_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga Shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_IKO_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "
"FSM_IKO_4"	"Now the over-mighty clans no longer obey."
"FSM_IKO_5"	"The time has come for a new warlord to become Shogun."
"FSM_IKO_6"	"But who will win?  "
"FSM_IKO_7"	"We Ikko Ikki are from every corner of Japan, united in one cause! We are the only true believers!"
"FSM_IKO_8"	"Our faith gives us power against any who oppose the will of heaven."
"FSM_IKO_9"	"Our numbers swell as more flee from the great lords and their cruelty."
"FSM_MOR_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_MOR_10"	"The waves are unforgiving: Mori sailors have strength and great skill!"
"FSM_MOR_11"	"Skills passed down from father to son. They make us strong in war!"
"FSM_MOR_12"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_MOR_13"	"All will bow to the Mori clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_MOR_14"	"Destiny calls!"
"FSM_MOR_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_MOR_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "
"FSM_MOR_4"	"Now the over-mighty clans no longer obey."
"FSM_MOR_5"	"The time has come for a new warlord to become shogun."
"FSM_MOR_6"	"But who will be victorious?  "
"FSM_MOR_7"	"Mori lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_MOR_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_MOR_9"	"Others work the land. We are sea-masters, our ships the envy of all!"
"FSM_ODA_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_ODA_10"	"All know us, the commanders of a thousand spears. It is an honour to lead such men. "
"FSM_ODA_11"	"Our generals are battle-scarred veterans of righteous strength."
"FSM_ODA_12"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_ODA_13"	"All will bow to the Oda clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_ODA_14"	"Destiny calls!"
"FSM_ODA_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_ODA_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "
"FSM_ODA_4"	"Now the over-mighty clans no longer obey."
"FSM_ODA_5"	"The time has come for a new warlord to become shogun."
"FSM_ODA_6"	"But who will be victorious?  "
"FSM_ODA_7"	"Oda lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_ODA_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_ODA_9"	"Others may covet titles, but ashigaru, common spearmen, are the bedrock of Oda might."
"FSM_SHI_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_SHI_10"	"It is in our blood, our traditions."
"FSM_SHI_11"	"And in battle, our swordsmen are the envy of Japan. No blade is swifter, or more feared than ours."
"FSM_SHI_12"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_SHI_13"	"All will bow to the Shimazu clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_SHI_14"	"Destiny calls!"
"FSM_SHI_2"	"For 200 years the Ashikaga shoguns have ruled from Kyoto."
"FSM_SHI_3"	"Great splendour and power were theirs. "

"FSM_SHI_5"	"The time has come for a new warlord to become shogun."
"FSM_SHI_6"	"But who will be victorious?  "
"FSM_SHI_7"	"Shimazu lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_SHI_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_SHI_9"	"We trace a line back to the first shogun, Yoritomo. Loyalty runs deep in the Shimazu. "
"FSM_TAK_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
"FSM_TAK_10"	"Let others march! We ride! We fly! Like storms in the mountains we thunder in battle!"
"FSM_TAK_11"	"Bishamonten, the war god, has woken! Now is the time to defeat our enemies!  "
"FSM_TAK_12"	"All will bow to the Takeda clan. We wait no longer. "
"FSM_TAK_13"	"Destiny calls!"

"FSM_TAK_7"	"Takeda lands have always provided for our people."
"FSM_TAK_8"	"Our enemies are many and envious. They threaten our borders, and look for any weakness."
"FSM_TAK_9"	"To be Takeda is to be born in the saddle! We are master horsemen: our cavalry astound all!"
"FSM_TOK_1"	"Fifteen forty-five. This is the Sengoku Jidai: the Age of the Country at War."
