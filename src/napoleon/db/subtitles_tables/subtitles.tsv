"NCS_01_Tut_Intro.bik_01"	"Some men live and die in the shade of their olive trees."
"NCS_01_Tut_Intro.bik_02"	"A lifetime of peace and simplicity."
"NCS_01_Tut_Intro.bik_03"	"This book is the record of a man who wanted more: a man who wanted everything."
"NCS_01_Tut_Intro.bik_04"	"His name was Napoleon Bonaparte: soldier, general, emperor."
"NCS_01_Tut_Intro.bik_05"	"Yet all things have a beginning."
"NCS_01_Tut_Intro.bik_06"	"There was a time when Napoleon was just a boy, a boy from Corsica."
"NCS_02_Tut_Outro.bik_01"	"As the British warships fled the harbour, so did Napoleon’s last doubts in his abilities."
"NCS_02_Tut_Outro.bik_02"	"He had stepped from the shadows to take command and led his soldiers to victory."
"NCS_02_Tut_Outro.bik_03"	"At 24, Napoleon was a Brigadier General of Artillery."
"NCS_02_Tut_Outro.bik_04"	"Now, he wanted an army.  The years of waiting were almost over."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_01"	"Some men live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_02"	"I do not know when the fire in Napoleon first burned. Perhaps he had always had a destiny."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_03"	"But sometimes destiny can use a little help, or even a revolution."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_04"	"The old ways were drowned in a tide of blood."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_05"	"A man could be whatever he wanted, if he could weather the storm."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_06"	"In 1796, Napoleon was sent to command the Army of Italy."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_07"	"We knew that Austria would fight in Germany."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_08"	"We knew the Italian campaign had become pointless."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_09"	"Napoleon thought differently. That was his talent."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_10"	" \"I will lead you through the most fertile plains in the world. You will find there honour, glory and riches!\" he told us."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_11"	"The soldiers listened, but they didn’t believe."
"NCS_03_Ita_Intro.bik_12"	"They had long been without hope, without glory."
"NCS_04_Ita_Outro.bik_01"	"We cheered his name. We cheered for France. For victory. Because we had lived."
"NCS_04_Ita_Outro.bik_02"	"Now we trusted him. We were the Little Corporal’s soldiers."
"NCS_04_Ita_Outro.bik_03"	"The Austrians did not cheer. They feared this rustic Corsican. Their pride was stung: beaten by an uncouth man."
"NCS_04_Ita_Outro.bik_04"	"Pride did not stop them making peace. For a time."
"NCS_04_Ita_Outro.bik_05"	"\"I foresaw what I might be,\" Napoleon said, \"I felt the earth flee before me as if I was carried into the sky.\""
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_01"	"It was an age of exploration, of conquest everywhere."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_02"	"Frenchmen travelled the world: teaching, learning, trading."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_03"	"Always, the British were a threat. Their merchants took the best. Their ships strangled our trade. As Britain grew wealthy, France suffered."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_04"	"In the heat of summer, Napoleon landed in Egypt. Now, the East and its wealth would be ours."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_05"	"Egypt. Here the sands whisper stories of ancient victories and glories."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_06"	"Here, Napoleon felt the history of forty centuries upon his shoulders."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_07"	"“What I have done up to now is nothing” he said."
"NCS_05_Egy_Intro.bik_08"	"But the desert is harsh, unforgiving: bravery alone will not keep a man alive."
"NCS_06_Egy_Outro.bik_01"	"Egypt.  A victory here is to stand alongside Alexander, Caesar to be almost a God!"
"NCS_06_Egy_Outro.bik_02"	"December 1804: I was in Notre Dame."
"NCS_06_Egy_Outro.bik_03"	"With pride I watched Napoleon became the Emperor of France."
"NCS_06_Egy_Outro.bik_04"	"\"I found the French crown in the gutter,\" he said, \"And I picked it up.\""
"NCS_06_Egy_Outro.bik_05"	"Vive L’Empereur!"
"NCS_07_Eur_Intro.bik_01"	"France was a flame!"
"NCS_07_Eur_Intro.bik_02"	"Napoleon gave France greatness. He gave France everything: glory, justice, and law. Nothing was untouched: his code made justice a reality for all."
"NCS_07_Eur_Intro.bik_03"	"I watched the Emperor at work: he was a force of nature, a storm, blowing away the cobwebs."
"NCS_07_Eur_Intro.bik_04"	"The old enemies plotted against him: Britain, Austria, Russia, and their lickspittles."
"NCS_07_Eur_Intro.bik_05"	"Napoleon was to be removed and his flame extinguished."
"NCS_07_Eur_Intro.bik_06"	"We worked to stop them. In 1805 all of France, his empire, prepared for war."
"NCS_08_Eur_Outro.bik_01"	"Our enemies said we could not win."
"NCS_08_Eur_Outro.bik_02"	"What difference, they asked, could one man make?"
"NCS_08_Eur_Outro.bik_03"	"Every difference, I replied, if that man is Napoleon."
"NCS_08_Eur_Outro.bik_04"	"Napoleon watched their cities fall. He expected victory, nothing less would do. Victory came because he willed it."
"NCS_08_Eur_Outro.bik_05"	"Napoleon’s will – Napoleon’s ambition – set a match to the kindling of the world."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_01"	"A Russian winter: only a widow’s heart is colder."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_02"	"Soldiers died in the saddle. Their horses died beneath them. The Grand Army – died."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_03"	"The vultures gathered. Our enemies formed the Sixth Coalition – the sixth! – against Napoleon, against one man!"
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_04"	"We fought. It was not enough."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_05"	"In April 1814, Napoleon renounced the throne…"
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_06"	"time seemed to stop."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_07"	"Tiny Elba was to be his island empire. He stayed 10 months."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_08"	"In Spring 1815 Napoleon came home. He had no choice but to march on Paris. The worthless Bourbon king fled. Destiny awoke!"
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_09"	"Europe turned against us. Napoleon was “an enemy and disturber of the tranquillity of the world.” War was forced on us."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_10"	"The Emperor made his plans: go north, destroy the British and the Prussians separately, before they could meet. It would work. It had to work."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_11"	"The British made their stand on the Brussels road. Waterloo. French cannons and bayonets would carry the day."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_12"	"Then it began to rain.  Napoleon had wanted dry ground – he could not not manoeuvre his artillery in the mud."
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_13"	"On that June morning, Napoleon spoke to us: \"This day will decide the destiny of Europe. This day is everything. If we lose, we have nothing.\""
"NCS_09_Waterloo.bik_14"	"Once again, the cannons would speak."
"NCS_10_Win.bik_01"	"Waterloo: by nightfall, the only Englishmen on the field were dead, dying or captive."
"NCS_10_Win.bik_02"	"France was safe. The Emperor was triumphant. This was his greatest victory."
"NCS_10_Win.bik_03"	"I do not think France will see his like again. I pray that it is never necessary. Glory like that can only be survived once."
"NCS_10_Win.bik_04"	"Some men live and die in the shade of their olive trees.  Some men change the world."
"NCS_10_Win.bik_05"	"\"My true title of glory is that I will live forever.\""
"NCS_11_Lose.bik_01"	"Waterloo: by nightfall, even the Old Guard was running."
"NCS_11_Lose.bik_02"	"Dear God! That such a thing could happen!"
"NCS_11_Lose.bik_03"	"Surrender was bitter: exile to St. Helena, a speck of rock – I do not like to think of it. Remembered glories are sour, by their very nature."
"NCS_11_Lose.bik_04"	"Some men live and die in the shade of their olive trees. Some change the world, even in defeat."
"NCS_11_Lose.bik_05"	"\"Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily.\""
"NHB_01_Arcole.bik_01"	"Austrians annoy me."
"NHB_01_Arcole.bik_02"	"Their constant attempts to break the siege of Mantua had to be stopped."
"NHB_01_Arcole.bik_03"	" I had to intercept the Austrians in open battle. Now, even after I have beaten them, more is needed."
"NHB_01_Arcole.bik_04"	"Here, at Arcole, I will lead the army across the Alpone River and through the Austrian lines."
"NHB_02_Pyramids.bik_01"	"Victory in Italy! Now Egypt."
"NHB_02_Pyramids.bik_02"	"Alexandria fell as I expected. I knew that Murad Bey would send his Mamelukes to stop me before Cairo."
"NHB_02_Pyramids.bik_03"	"And, almost in the shadows of the Pyramids, the battle has come! My men will conquer for me, just as Alexander’s warriors did in ages past!"
"NHB_03_Nile.bik_01"	"Egypt is not enough. Beyond: the road to India and the crushing of British hopes there."
"NHB_03_Nile.bik_02"	" I told lies, I schemed, I got my army to Egypt. But “Perfidious Albion” does not like cleverness in others, and they fell upon my fleet in Aboukir Bay."
"NHB_04_Austerlitz.bik_01"	"I was forced to abandon my campaign in Egypt to deal with traitors in Paris. But the bayonet is an eloquent argument!"
"NHB_04_Austerlitz.bik_02"	"I became First Consul. I took the crown because it was there. And who else could?"
"NHB_04_Austerlitz.bik_03"	"But I scared Austria, Russia – old Europe – and they marched. Here, at Austerlitz, I will stop them!"
"NHB_05_Trafalgar.bik_01"	"Villeneuve understands nothing. Villeneuve has achieved nothing!"
"NHB_05_Trafalgar.bik_02"	"Without control of the seas, how can I invade England? Now, the “Army of England” must move against Austria."
"NHB_05_Trafalgar.bik_03"	"Villeneuve can earn his pay, and go into the Mediterranean. That should be simple enough for him…"
"NHB_06_Borodino.bik_01"	"If you want an Englishman to see sense, take his money!"
"NHB_06_Borodino.bik_02"	"The Russian continued trading. Do they think I wanted to invade? To march on Moscow?"
"NHB_06_Borodino.bik_03"	"And now Kutuzov makes a stand, at Borodino, some speck on the map! No matter, I will dine in Moscow yet!"
"NHB_07_Dresden.bik_01"	"Moscow did not agree with my digestion. The Russians burned it rather than leave it to me. And then treachery in Paris."
"NHB_07_Dresden.bik_02"	"I ordered a withdrawal. And my enemies, the Sixth Coalition, suddenly found courage."
"NHB_07_Dresden.bik_03"	" I must show them real soldiering again, at Dresden, to save Marshal Saint-Cyr."
"NHB_08_Ligny.bik_01"	"As a military man, I must be realistic about Leipzig."
"NHB_08_Ligny.bik_02"	"Disloyalty was worse: I was glad to go to Elba away from my self-seeking, mealy-mouthed, turncoat Marshals."
"NHB_08_Ligny.bik_03"	"But what is France without Napoleon? Now we march again, all France in arms!"
"NHB_09_Waterloo.bik_01"	"I must trust Grouchy to keep the Prussians on the run. Ney: he has forced the enemy to go north. We followed at their heels. And now, there is this English general, this Wellington."
"NHB_09_Waterloo.bik_02"	"They tell me he was good, in Spain. Beaten men would say that.  Is he as good as me? We shall see."
"NHB_SE_01_Lodi.bik_01"	"Turin lay in my sights. The Piedmontese let my army pass. The Austrians under Beaulieu fell back on Milan."
"NHB_SE_01_Lodi.bik_02"	" I pressed hard, and caught them at Lodi. Sebottendorf can read a battlefield: he can see that I must send men over the only bridge, across the River Po, and take on his men on the east bank."
"NHB_SE_01_Lodi.bik_03"	"But can he see what is coming next?"
"NHB_SE_02_Friedland.bik_01"	"Without Berlin, the Prussians came to terms. I turned then on the Russians in Poland."
"NHB_SE_02_Friedland.bik_02"	"Yet at Eylau, something happened: my army shuddered, for a moment. So they had suffered? No matter."
"NHB_SE_02_Friedland.bik_03"	"But I had to take personal control to restore French – that is, my – glory."
"WEL_Waterloo.bik_01"	"Napoleon seems unstoppable. His armies pushed us aside with ease."
"WEL_Waterloo.bik_02"	"There has been little rest on the retreat."
"WEL_Waterloo.bik_03"	"But here we will make a stand."
"WEL_Waterloo.bik_04"	"Napoleon has pushed. He goes no further."
"WEL_Waterloo.bik_05"	"Gentlemen in London will envy anyone here, today, who faces the Emperor and his army."
"WEL_Waterloo.bik_06"	"At Waterloo."
