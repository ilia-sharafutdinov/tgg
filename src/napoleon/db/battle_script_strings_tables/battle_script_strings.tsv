"CreativeAssembly.HB_Arcole_Intro_5"	"We must capture Arcole in the East to carry the day. At the same time, I must resist pressure from the Austrians to the West"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Arcole_Narration"	"Austrians annoy me. Their constant attempts to break the siege of Mantua had to be stopped. I had to intercept the Austrians in open battle. Now, even after I have beaten them, more is needed. Here, at Arcole, I will lead the army across the Alpone River and through the Austrian lines."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Arcole_sfx_1"	"General! The Austrians are advancing across the marsh! We must intercept them!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Arcole_sfx_2"	"This is a sensational victory. The Austrians are driven from the field! With the capture of Arcole, they will be forced to stop their campaign in Italy! Formidable!"	"Berthier"

"CreativeAssembly.HB_Austerlitz_Intro_5"	"One sharp blow and the war is over."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Austerlitz_Narration"	"I was forced to abandon my campaign in Egypt to deal with traitors in Paris. But the bayonet is an eloquent argument! I became First Consul. I took the crown because it was there. And who else could? But I scared Austria, Russia – old Europe – and they marched. Here, at Austerlitz, I will stop them!"	"Napoleon"

"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_Intro_1"	"September 7th, 1812. Mikhail Kutuzov finally made his stand on the east bank of the Kolocha River between the new and old Moscow to Smolensk roads just south of Borodino."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_Intro_2"	"To fortify the northern section of his right flank, Kutuzov's troops have constructed the Raevski redoubt. This stretches down to Semenovskaia village."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_Intro_3"	"To the south he has constructed the three Vee-shaped Bagration Fleches."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_Intro_4"	"Taking the Redoubt and Bagration Fleches will be the stiffest of challenges!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_Narration"	"If you want an Englishman to see sense, take his money! The Russian continued trading. Do they think I wanted to invade? To march on Moscow? And now Kutuzov makes a stand, at Borodino, some speck on the map! No matter, I will dine in Moscow yet!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_sfx_1"	"Kutuzov has strengthened his left flank; his right flank looks weak; the town Borodino should be taken!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_sfx_2"	"To fortify the northern section of his right flank, Kutuzov's troops have constructed the Raevski redoubt. This stretches down to Semenovskaia village."	"Berthier"

"CreativeAssembly.HB_Borodino_sfx_4"	"Taking the Redoubt and Bagration Fleches will be a challenge, even for me."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Battle_Lost"	"I swear, upon my honour, that my Grande Armée will not know defeat ever again!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Battle_Won"	"Outnumbered, outgunned, and I still triumph! This coalition is a band of fools to oppose my will!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Intro_1"	"August 26th, 1813. Dresden, on the banks of the River Elbe, has been surrounded by the vast forces of the Allied Coalition."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Intro_2"	"The vast Austrian, Prussian and Russian forces, under General Schwarzenberg, believe they have cornered one of my commanders. They expect the city to fall without much resistance."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Intro_3"	"Within the city, French infantry man the various redoubts and defensive positions, in the hope of lasting long enough for reinforcements to arrive."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Intro_4"	"To the north of the river, my reserves are ready to cross the river and either strike at the enemy or move towards Dresden and reinforce the city's defences."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_Narration"	"Moscow did not agree with my digestion. The Russians burned it rather than leave it to me. And then treachery in Paris. I ordered a withdrawal. And my enemies, the Sixth Coalition, suddenly found courage. I must show them real soldiering again, at Dresden, to save Marshal Saint-Cyr."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_1"	"The Prussians continue to shell Dresden!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_10"	"We're surrounded!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_11"	"Fall back across the river and re-group!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_2"	"We have lost one of the redoubts!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_3"	"The enemy has captured one of our redoubts!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_4"	"Dresden will fall if we cannot rout the enemy!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_5"	"The Coalition forces have entered the Grand Gardens!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_6"	"Victory will certainly be ours!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_7"	"The Austrian cavalry is charging!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_8"	"Hold the redoubts!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Dresden_sfx_9"	"Watch the river crossings outside the city! The enemy may move on our flank!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Battle_Lost"	"I am Emperor of France. I will not kneel to any man, even if he has the armies of the world at his back! I refuse to be defeated!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Battle_Won"	"Prussia, Russia, Austria, Britain, even Sweden! Let them come! My Grande Armée will prevail!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Intro_1"	"June 14th, 1807. General Bennigsen has made a grave error in his judgement. Ordering his entire army across the d'Alle to the west of Friedland, he believes his force vastly outnumbers my deceptively isolated Lannes' V Corps."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Intro_2"	"In addition Gorchakov and Bagration are providing Bennigsen with additional Russian troops on the right and left flanks respectively."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Intro_3"	"To my northern left flank, Grouchy and Nansouty's cavalry occupy the village of Heinrichsdorf and should provide excellent cover for my main assault."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Intro_4"	"Marshall Lannes occupies the centre and will tempt my Russian enemies in, to what will prove to be their demise."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Intro_5"	"In an effort to further draw the Russian's in, Lannes has allowed his forces to become separated with his grenadiers taking up position in Sortlack forest to my southern right flank."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Intro_6"	"The Russians will want to end this encounter quickly before I can arrive with my reinforcements. I must make haste."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_Narration"	"Without Berlin, the Prussians came to terms. I turned then on the Russians in Poland. Yet at Eylau, something happened: my army shuddered, for a moment. So they had suffered? No matter. But I had to take personal control to restore French – that is, my – glory."	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_1"	"The Russians are crossing the Alle River."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_2"	"Hold until reinforcements arrive!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_3"	"We are outgunned! Hold on for reinforcements!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_4"	"Now, with your reinforcements, take the battle to the Russians!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_5"	"We can't sustain this sort of damage for now."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_6"	"Napoléon and our reinforcements have arrived!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Friedland_sfx_7"	"The woods of Sortlack may prove to be good cover!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Battle_Lost"	"So, one plan has failed! There are other plans, and other battles yet to fight. I will not yield to these Prussians or these British amateurs."	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Battle_Won"	"My enemies retreat, then, away from their allies. This war will not last long. Let us hope there will be time for glory!"	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Intro_1"	"June 16th, 1815. Blücher's forces have entrenched themselves in the towns along the Ligny stream. I have ordered Vandamme to take St. Amand and St. Amand La Haye on the left flank."	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Intro_2"	"In the centre Gerard has been given the task of taking Ligny."	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Intro_3"	"My right flank is protected by a strong contingent of cavalry. They are under orders to attack the Prussian left stationed around the town of Tongrinne."	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Intro_4"	"I must be careful of Blücher's reserves, a strong mix of cavalry and infantry. He is an old fox."	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_Narration"	"As a military man, I must be realistic about Leipzig. Disloyalty was worse: I was glad to go to Elba away from my self-seeking, mealy-mouthed, turncoat Marshals. But what is France without Napoléon? Now we march again, all France in arms! Ney will hold Wellington, and I will deal a blow to that old windbag Blücher!"	"Napoleon Old"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_1"	"We must take St. Amand if we are to reach the artillery that overlooks the town!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_2"	"Capture the artillery on the hill!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_3"	"We are likely to be pinned down by cannon fire, unless we get across the river!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_4"	"The Prussians are defending Ligny! Beyond is their main army!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_5"	"We must push across the river."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_6"	"We have captured Tongrinne!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_7"	"We have captured St. Amand!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_8"	"We have captured St. Amand La Haye!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Ligny_sfx_9"	"We have captured Ligny!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Battle_Lost"	"A small setback, to be sure, but I will stop the Austrians from reaching Milan!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Battle_Won"	"Beaulieu is the Austrian army! They are nothing without him! Northern Italy is mine!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_General_sfx_1"	"General Beaulieu has taken up position on the far side of the river! Do not allow him to escape!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_General_sfx_2"	"General Beaulieu has been killed on the battlefield! Mop up the remainder of his army to secure victory!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_General_sfx_3"	"General Beaulieu has escaped! Your failure to capture him will ensure the rebirth of Austrian resistance in North-West Italy!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_General_sfx_4"	"The Austrian General, Beaulieu, is leaving the field! Catch him, capture him, kill him! He must not be allowed to escape!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Intro_1"	"May 10th, 1796. After two days of forced marching, my army has caught the retreating Austrian army at Lodi."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Intro_2"	"This is the time to strike!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Intro_3"	"The Austrian rearguard is seperated from the main army and vulnerable until it can reach the safety of the town."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Intro_4"	"General Beaulieu is forced to stay on the battlefield to oversee the Austrian retreat."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Intro_5"	"We must capture or kill the Austrian General and much of his force to end Austrian interests in North-West Italy."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Intro_6"	"If Beaulieu is removed, the French can pen the Austrians in Lombardy into the fortress at Mantua. I must prevent Beaulieu from escaping the battlefield!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Lodi_Narration"	"Turin lay in my sights. The Piedmontese let my army pass. The Austrians under Beaulieu fell back on Milan. I pressed hard, and caught them at Lodi. Sebottendorf can read a battlefield: he can see that I must send men over the only bridge, across the River Po, and take on his men on the east bank. But can he see what is coming next?"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Battle_Lost"	"What use is a fleet in a sea of sand? I have lost when I say I have lost!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Battle_Won"	"The British, then, are not as cunning as they think. Their seamanship also leaves a little to be desired."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Intro_1"	"August 1st, 1798. Anchored off the coast of Alexandria, my fleet is under the command of François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers. The ships are in the shallow waters of Aboukir Bay to defend the gateway to Egypt."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Intro_2"	"To the northeast, in the open sea, a superior British fleet lies in wait under the command of Horatio Nelson."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Intro_3"	"An attack from the British is inevitable, but only a great Admiral would risk his ships in the shallow waters at night."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Intro_4"	"We must protect Alexandria at all costs and expect an attack in the morning."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_Narration"	"Egypt is not enough. Beyond: the road to India and the crushing of British hopes there. I told lies, I schemed, I got my army to Egypt. But “Perfidious Albion” does not like cleverness in others, and they fell upon my fleet in Aboukir Bay."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_sfx_1"	"May the winds be in our favour!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_sfx_2"	"Our ship has run aground!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_sfx_3"	"The British are dead in the water!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Nile_sfx_4"	"Brace for impact!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Battle_Lost"	"The desert is a harsh teacher. I have learned, and next time, I will apply the lesson in full! They will be defeated!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Battle_Won"	"The glories and treasures of Egypt will soon be mine! To walk in the footsteps of Caesar!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Intro_1"	"July 21st, 1798. The Mameluke army is old fashioned, but their cavalry is swift and deadly. Our cavalry reserves are limited. Our only hope of defeating the enemy is to adopt square formations and hope to survive the coming charge."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Intro_2"	"The villages of Embabeh and Biktil will be key to success. Embabeh, to the east, is held by Mameluke artillery, and overlooks our flank. I must take this quickly to prevent serious losses."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Intro_3"	"The Ottoman army consists of a large number of Mamelukes. Square formation will be key to our success on the battlefield."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Intro_4"	"Biktil, in the west, is held by our forces. I should use this as a foothold to push into the Mameluke ranks."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Intro_5"	"Using the French army's superior weaponry, technology and training to their fullest extent will be the best way to secure my victory."	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_Narration"	"Victory in Italy! Now Egypt. Alexandria fell as I expected. I knew that Murad Bey would send his Mamelukes to stop me before Cairo. And, almost in the shadows of the Pyramids, the battle has come! My men will conquer for me, just as Alexander’s warriors did in ages past!"	"Napoleon Young"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_sfx_1"	"Biktil has fallen to the Ottomans!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_sfx_2"	"Ottoman cavalry is assaulting our right flank, near the village of Biktil."	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Pyramids_sfx_3"	"The Ottomans are fleeing from Embabeh! The village is ours!"	"Berthier"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Trafalgar_Battle_Lost"	"The British are fine sailors, but so what? Frenchmen should not suffer defeat at their hands!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Trafalgar_Battle_Won"	"This is not a victory for France or Spain! It is a victory for all in Europe who hate the British, which is to say: all of Europe!"	"Napoleon"
"CreativeAssembly.HB_Trafalgar_Intro_1"	"October 21st, 1805. Off the south-west coast of Spain near Cadiz my Franco-Spanish fleet, under Pierre de Villeneuve, has unwisely set sail for Naples."	"Napoleon"
